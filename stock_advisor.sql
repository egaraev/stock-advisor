Twitch was then primarily a live video streaming platform for gamers. Over the years, it has focused on becoming the primary source for interactive live content with expansions into streaming music, artwork, talk shows, cooking, and more. With millions of unique monthly streamers, Twitch is one of the top-rated websites in the world. According to data from Alexa.com, it''s ranked 36 in terms of global internet engagement. Twitch leads the esports streaming market by a huge margin. A report from StreamElements, a platform that offers streamers various tools and services, puts Twitch''s market share at 61% as of Dec. 2019. The other top players in this space, including YouTube Gaming, Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) Gaming, and Microsoft Mixer, have shares of 28%, 9%, and 3%, respectively. At the end of 2019, Twitch had approximately 3.4 million monthly broadcasters and 15 million daily users on its platform. And last year, users watched over 11 billion hours of content, up 18% year over year.  IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.  Twitch generates sales through advertising, subscriptions, and cheer bits (like a tip for streamers), while free users have access to ad-supported streaming content. When a user wants to support individual streamers, the subscription fee ranges between $4.99 and $24.99 per month. The subscribed viewer will then enjoy access to ad-free content, special alerts, and exclusive streaming events. The top streamers also generate revenue by selling merchandise on top of the subscription revenue shared between Twitch and its content creators. Though Amazon does not disclose the exact amount of revenue Twitch generates, one report from The Information estimates Twitch''s ad sales amounted to just $230 million in 2018 and $300 million in 2019. However, these figures fall short of the company''s target of $500 million to $600 million in ad revenue for 2019. When Twitch was first acquired for $1.1 billion, ad revenue was estimated at $72 million. And according to a PC Mag report, Twitch''s total GVC (gaming video content) sales topped $1.5 billion in 2019. GVC revenue includes sales from ads, subscriptions, donations, and sponsorships.  These figures are immaterial to a massive enterprise like Amazon, but the company is betting on the huge market opportunity that could make esports a multibillion-dollar industry by the end of this decade. The esports market is still in a nascent stage. The total number of viewers was 380 million in 2018, though gaming research company Newzoo estimates this figure will reach 557 million by 2021. Despite these seemingly impressive viewership numbers, the global esports industry is valued at only $1 billion as of this writing, and streaming is an integral part of this market. Twitch has managed to increase user engagement over the years. The average daily time spent on the platform is 95 minutes per user, which is a stellar number for audience engagement. The company is now seeking to engage viewers in other ways. For example, Twitch''s IRL (In Real Life) category is also gaining popularity. Here, users can chat with streamers in real-time. Users can have a sense of personal connection with content creators, something traditional sports have so far failed to do. Steadily growing viewership and engagement will help Twitch sustain its revenue growth long term, meaning it should ultimately hit the $1 billion ad revenue target the company has in place. While Twitch accounts for 61% of the esports streaming market, it is losing ground to Facebook Gaming, which experienced a 210% year-over-year increase in hours watched during December. However, smaller players tend to grow at a faster rate compared to the more established competitors. But Facebook does have a massive advantage as it already has billions of users around the world on its various social media platforms. Twitch, on the other hand, will try to leverage Amazon''s reach in online retail and traditional streaming to try and convert its customers into esports enthusiasts. Beyond gaming, Twitch is working with Buzzfeed, Sky News, and Cheddar to create streaming content for the platform. Investors should know this growth story is far from over. Amazon can continue to benefit from its leadership position in esports streaming and the global growth of esports, which will drive viewership growth and result in incremental subscription and ad sales for Twitch.

It''s no surprise that it''s relatively easy to find an article suggesting that cloud gaming is the future of video games. What might be surprising is that the article I mentioned above is from 2012. The worry about console gaming''s decline then was connected to the popularity of mobile games. In today''s world, where companies from Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) to Alphabet are jumping into cloud gaming with both feet, is this the end of the traditional console? In a word, no. Mobile gaming has been a fast-growing part of the gaming market, yet it didn''t spell the end of traditional consoles. In the same way, cloud gaming services may take a portion of the market, but they won''t take over the industry, as some analysts assume. Just to put the future of gaming into numbers, industry analyst Newzoo found spending on video games reached more than $150 billion in 2019. By 2022, total spending is expected to fall just short of $200 billion. This same study suggests that mobile gaming will make up nearly half of all game revenue. Console gaming isn''t expected to disappear either, reaching more than $61 billion by 2022. Given this backdrop, there are multiple myths about the future of cloud gaming that investors need to squash right away. Image credit: Getty Images Many articles related to cloud gaming suggest that the cost of hardware is a barrier. What investors should remember is that just because an argument is made repeatedly doesn''t make it true. There have been approximately eight generations of game consoles. Console sales tend to overlap as older models become a better value relative to newly introduced systems. Since 1972, the average console cycle has been just over 13 years on average. Using this as a template, the argument for a cloud-exclusive gaming subscription is challenging to accept. System Initial Cost Monthly Cost 5-Year Total Cost Microsoft Xbox One S 1TB – Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order bundle $299 $5 (Xbox Live Gold 12-month price) $594 PS4 1TB Slim Fortnite Neo Versa Bundle $299 $5 (PlayStation Plus) $599 Google Stadia Premium Edition $129 (comes with a three-month Stadia Pro subscription) $9.99 (Stadia Pro) $698.43 Microsoft xCloud $59.99 (Xbox One controller) $15* (xCloud suggested pricing) $959.99* (Source: Xbox One S 1TB and Xbox Live 12mo; PS4 1TB Slim Fortnite Neo Versa Bundle and PlayStation Plus 12mo; Google Stadia Premium Edition and Stadia Pro monthly subscription; Microsoft xCloud requires Xbox controller and *xCloud suggested pricing -- author''s 5yr calculation) If saving money is the goal, Google Stadia and xCloud leave much to be desired. Xbox Live Gold gives subscribers at least three free games per month. Over a five-year period, users would have access to 180 free games. Many analysts are looking for cloud gaming services to become the Netflix of gaming with unlimited access to tons of free titles. Google Stadia offers one free game and xCloud''s test offers about 50 games. Given the pricing, the comparison to the thousands of hours of entertainment that Netflix offers is questionable at best. There are multiple holes in the theory that cloud gaming is a better solution than what is currently available. One big issue is that mobile gamers don''t seem to have a need to pay for these services. Last year''s top-grossing mobile game was Fate/Grand Order. This is a free-to-play anime game. Like many others, the way the game makes money is through in-app purchases. Other top free games include titles such as Johnny Trigger, Paper.io, Roblox and Candy Crush Saga. The top paid mobile games normally have an upfront cost of less than $10. Mobile game revenue is expected to comprise roughly half of total video game revenue in the next few years. Given this fact, the free-to-play phenomenon seems to argue against paying for a cloud-based service. On the console side of the house, the trouble with cloud-based gaming goes beyond the cost. Game publishers are increasingly relying on offering both console level games and mobile games as differentiated experiences. The most recent example is Activision Blizzard''s Call of Duty franchise. Despite the traditional Call of Duty''s predictable console and PC release schedule, Call of Duty: Mobile has met with early success. In the first month, the game garnered 148 million downloads. By point of comparison, Fortnite garnered 35 million downloads in its first month. In addition, many console games offer a single-player mode that doesn''t require online access. When it comes to upcoming hardware releases, the next generation of Xbox and PlayStation reportedly will offer 8K resolution and solid-state drives (SSDs). These improvements should allow consoles gamers to experience faster load times and quicker updates. When we combine the popularity of free-to-play mobile games, a long hardware cycle, potentially better graphics and load times, it seems the industry is already addressing the needs that cloud gaming was hoping to answer. The third myth surrounding cloud gaming is because music and movies both moved from physical media to streaming services, video games are the next logical industry to take this step. The first issue is that streaming high-quality music or DVD-quality video require significantly less bandwidth than a video game. Google Stadia says that to achieve 4K quality gaming, subscribers need 30 to 35 Mbps internet speeds. While this speed is achievable for many, one challenge facing cloud gaming is internet provider data caps. Comcast gives a 1 TB monthly data allowance, which sounds like a significant amount. However, a study last year found the average gamer worldwide spent about 7 hours per week playing video games, an annual increase of more than 19%. To put this into perspective, 28 hours of 4K gaming on Google Stadia would use about 430 GB in a month. If we add to this deluge of data, the fact that last year worldwide users spent nearly 7 hours per week on average streaming video, we can see that this 1 TB of data could be used up much faster than some would realize. From an investment standpoint, Microsoft seems to be a better gaming prospect than Alphabet at present. One of the challenges facing the company will be the pricing of xCloud. If the service prices at $15 a month, as some expect, Microsoft may need to combine xCloud and its popular Game Pass service to make the cost palpable. Game Pass gives users access to about 100 games they can download and play as much as they want. Subscribers are already paying $14.99 per month for this service. Having access to Game Pass through xCloud could cause Game Pass subscription revenue to jump. On the other hand, if Microsoft requires gamers to pay $15 for xCloud, and $14.99 for Game Pass, the cloud gaming dream could be a tough pill to swallow. On a positive note, in Microsoft''s last conference call, CEO Satya Nadella said, "We set a new record for Xbox Live monthly users again this quarter, led by the strength of Console." In addition, he mentioned Xbox Game Pass subscribers more than doubled. In short, Microsoft already has a subscription gaming model in place. Between the company''s nascent cloud offerings, the ubiquity of Office, and an upcoming refresh of gaming consoles, Microsoft''s pillars of growth are clear. Investors looking to cash in on gaming''s future should have Microsoft on their buy list.  10 stocks we like better than MicrosoftWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

From last night to this morning, Johns Hopkins University''s coronavirus tracking website recorded 3,173 new cases of the disease -- a 10% increase. Compared to a week ago, today''s 31,526 confirmed cases represent a 179% increase in infections.   A total of 638 people have died from the coronavirus, and 1,764 patients have fully recovered. Image source: Getty Images. Business in China, the origin place of the illness and the country most affected by coronavirus today (99% of all cases reported), is starting to feel serious effects. In Shenzen for example, Bloomberg reports Foxconn, Apple''s (NASDAQ: AAPL) primary contractor for production of iPhones and other electronic devices, has instructed employees to not return to work at the end of their Lunar New Year holiday on Feb.10.   At least two companies, Canada Goose (NYSE: GOOS) and Burberry (OTC: BURBY), have blamed coronavirus concerns for reductions in their forward earnings guidance. A third clothier, VF Corp (NYSE: VFC), says it''s closing 60% of its stores in China temporarily in response to the health crisis. And coronavirus concerns are starting to be felt even outside of China. Citing fears of infection, two major tech companies, Sweden''s Ericsson (NASDAQ: ERIC) and South Korea''s LG Electronics, have pulled out of the upcoming MWC Barcelona 2020 tech conference. A third tech giant, Finland''s Nokia (NYSE: NOK), is mulling a similar move. And closer to home, the Royal Caribbean (NYSE: RCL) cruise ship Anthem of the Seas was boarded by officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the port of Bayonne, New Jersey who screened 27 passengers for coronavirus and removed four from the vessel for evaluation at a local hospital.   Royal Caribbean shares are down 3.3% as of 11 a.m. EST this morning in response to the news.  10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Worldwide smartphone shipments fell by more than 4% in 2018, and when the final tally is done, it''s expected to show that the declines continued into 2019, falling an additional 1.4%, according to market intelligence company IDC. The growing penetration of the smartphone and incremental technological innovations are simply prompting users to keep their devices longer. There''s also been little doubt that a large chunk of Apple''s future growth will come from wearables, which is especially true regarding the Apple Watch and AirPods. New data reveals that in 2019, the Apple Watch outsold the entire Swiss watch industry -- combined. Image source: Apple. The Apple Watch sold nearly 31 million units last year, up 36% year over year, and selling far more timepieces than the whole Swiss Watch industry, which sold about 21 million units, according to a report by research and consulting firm Strategy Analytics. The data suggests that Apple continues to steal market share from the traditional timepiece industry, as sales of Swiss watches slipped 13%. A previous report shows that Apple also controls nearly half of global smartwatch shipments, with 48% of the market, more than its next two competitors combined. Samsung accounts for 13% of sales, while Fitbit (NYSE: FIT) represents about 11%.  "A blend of attractive design, user-friendly tech and sticky apps makes the Apple Watch wildly popular in North America, Western Europe and Asia," said Steven Waltzer, senior analyst at Strategy Analytics. The Apple Watch has been a fan favorite since it was first released in early 2015, radically changing what consumers expect from a smartwatch. Global shipments of wearable devices -- of which the Apple Watch is a component -- climbed to 84.5 million units in the third quarter of 2019, posting year-over-year growth of nearly 95%, while also breaking the record for shipments in a single quarter, according to data from IDC. This was an acceleration from the 29% growth in the second quarter and 55% increase in the first quarter. The majority of the growth was driven by new ear-worn wearables, or hearables (which include wireless headphones and earbuds) -- which accounted for nearly half the market in the third quarter. Apple represented a disproportionate share of growth in the category, shipping 29.5 million units, up a mind-boggling 196% year over year, and controlling 35% of the market. All signs point to Apple continuing its dominance in the wearables category for the foreseeable future. In Apple''s fiscal first quarter (which ended Dec. 28), the company reported record sales of wearables. During the conference call, CEO Tim Cook said that the Apple Watch set "an all-time revenue record during the quarter," while revealing that over 75% of customers who bought the device were new to the Apple Watch, having never purchased one before. The company also set an all-time record for AirPod sales. These records helped Apple generate more than $10 billion in sales in its wearables, home, and accessories segment, up 37% year over year, with "very strong double-digit performance across all five geographic segments," according to Cook. He broke that down even further, saying that "wearables as a category... grew 44%." Image source: Apple. The data shared above and Apple''s recent results illustrate just how dominant the company is in the wearables market and its momentum shows no signs of slowing. It also doesn''t hurt that Apple has an installed base on more than 1.5 billion devices, and more than 900 million of those are iPhones. Evercore ISI analyst Amit Daryanani estimated in November that there were about 75 million Apple Watches and 50 million AirPods currently in use, representing less than 10% of the installed base of iPhones. This gives Apple a vast target market and a long runway for wearables growth. It also gives the stock plenty of room for future gains.   10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The Nasdaq 100 lead the major US indices, gaining 1.5%, the Nasdaq Composite 1.3%, the S&P 500 0.7% and the Dow 30 0.5% while the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) lost 4.6%. The oil market continues to suffer with estimates that China’s oil consumption could decline by as much as 20%.  Despite a second coronavirus death being reported outside of China and the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in China exceeding 20,000 with the death count surpassing 400, the speed of the virus’s international increase appears to have slowed compared to last week, This potential good news coupled with another round of stimulus from the People’s Bank of China — another $71.2 billion of liquidity via reverse repo agreements on top of the $143 billion injection on Monday — led Asian markets to end the day higher, including a rebound in the Shanghai Index today.  European equities have followed suit and are up across the board while US equity futures point to a vibrant market open.  If you were expecting to read about the results of the Iowa Caucuses, we are sorry to inform you that an “election debacle” unfolded yesterday as the Democratic Party found “inconsistencies in the reporting.” According to Mandy McClure, the state party’s communications director, “The underlying data and paper trail is sound and will simply take time to further report the results.” Results could be released as soon as late today.  While this could make for some interesting barbs as we get ready for tonight’s annual State of the Union Address to a joint session of Congress at 9 PM ET, we suspect President Trump will take a victory lap on the economy and US-China trade deal. Investors will be listening to see what is likely to be on the President’s 2020 agenda including a potential middle-class tax cut, addressing healthcare costs and transparency, and infrastructure spending among other things. We’ll be sure to break it all down in tomorrow’s Daily Markets note.  Data Download The December Industrial Producer Prices in the Eurozone fell 0.7% YoY (+0% MoM) compared to the -1.4% move in November, marking the fifth consecutive month of declines. Declines in energy prices were the primary culprit behind the move lower.  The majority of the economic data to watch today will be US-centric and will include the weekly retail Redbook Index, December Factory Orders, the January ISM Index for New York, and IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index for February. Coming off its highest reading in the prior eight months in January and 2019 holiday shopping, we''ll be digging into the February IBD/TIPP with a focus on the Personal Financial Outlook and Six-Month Economic Outlook data. Stocks to Watch Cummins Engine (CMI) reported December quarter Non-GAAP EPS of $2.56, $0.10 ahead of the consensus forecast due in part to quarterly revenue that also topped expectations. Given the company''s core engine business, it''s guidance is viewed as a harbinger of the global economy, which means investors will likely pay more attention to its outlook for 2020 - "Based on the current forecast, Cummins projects full-year 2020 revenues to be down 8 to 12 percent…Revenue declines in 2020 are driven by lower truck production in North America, Europe, China, and India as well as lower projected demand in off-highway markets, including global Power Generation, mining, oil and gas, and construction markets."  Clorox (CLX) reported December quarter EPS of $1.46, $0.13 ahead of consensus expectations even as revenue for the quarter matched the consensus forecast. Clorox boosted its 2020 outlook to EPS of $6.10-6.25 from $6.05-6.20 vs. $6.16 consensus forecast driven by a low single-digit decrease to 1% increase in sales vs. the consensus that calls for roughly flat total sales. Sirius XM (SIRI) reported December quarter results that were largely in line with expectations and added approximately 1.1 million net new self-pay subscribers leading 2019 to end with nearly 30.0 million self-pay subscribers. Total net subscriber additions were 870,000, resulting in more than 34.9 million total SiriusXM subscribers at the end of 2019. Sirius issued downside 2020 guidance with revenue of ~$8.1 billion vs. $8.22 billion consensus with free cash flow approaching $1.7 billion.  Italian luxury carmaker Ferrari (RACE) reported December quarter results that missed EPS expectation despite the 9.7% YoY increase in revenue that outpaced the consensus forecast.  Ferrari shared its adjusted EBITDA should increase to between 1.38-1.43 billion euros in 2020 vs. prior guidance of over 1.3 billion euros that was set in its 2018 plan. Beauty salon company Regis (RGS) reported better than expected quarterly results even though its same-store sales fell 3.6% during its FY2Q as the number of transactions fell 6.6% YoY, which was offset by 3% growth in ticket. Same-store sales service -2.1% and retail -9.3% for the quarter. The Financial Times is reporting “Germany’s government has proposed a clampdown on anti-competitive behaviour by digital platforms, putting Berlin in the vanguard of European efforts to regulate companies including Google (GOOGL) and Amazon (AMZN). The draft “digital law” will strengthen the intervention powers of Germany’s competition watchdog, the Federal Cartel Office.” This bill is part of what is being labeled a “tech lash” that has governments considering “ways to limit the economic and social power of the tech giants and public disquiet grows about the potential threats they pose to competition, privacy and civil liberties.” Shares of Wynn Resorts (WYNN), MGM Resorts (MGM), Melco Entertainment (MLCO), Las Vegas Sands (LVS), and Studio City International (MSC) will once again be under the spotlight following Macau said it will shut its $40 billion casino industry for two weeks in a bid to counter the spread of the coronavirus. Sony (SNE) boosted its outlook citing strong sales of smartphone image sensors as smartphone makers compete to adopt larger image sensors and multiple lenses on embedded cameras for the improved picture quality but warned of an impact from the Wuhan coronavirus on its global supply chain. The company shared its sensor shipments could be disrupted if the spread of the coronavirus forces its smartphone customers to suspend their assembly plants in China for a prolonged period. Yesterday Alphabet gained nearly 4% during normal trading hours only to reverse those gains to end down 1.3% in extended trading after the company reported an earnings beat that was 23% above expectations, but revenue and operating income missed expectations. For the first time, the company broke out cloud and YouTube revenues but didn''t reveal what percentage of YouTube revenue goes to its content creators. Cloud revenue rose 53% from the same quarter last year but operating income came in below expectations as did capex.  Tesla (TSLA) shares are trading higher in pre-market action following Panasonic (PCRFF) reporting the first quarterly profit in its U.S. battery business with Tesla, which followed years of production troubles and delays. This follows yesterday’s 20% gain in TSLA shares that continued the sharp move higher since the company reports its most recent quarterly results last week. The company’s market cap has reached $141 billion which is more than the combined market caps of Nissan Motor Corp (NSANF), General Motors (GM), Ford Motor Co (F), and Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) which have conversely all declined YTD, -7.7%, -7.5%, -3.6% and -11.6% respectively. One the other hand, of the top ten largest auto manufacturers, Tesla has only 2% of total revenues. Yesterday’s traded value as of roughly mid-afternoon yesterday was more than 205 of the traded value for all the stocks in the S&P 500. We don’t think there is a sufficient superlative word this what this stock has done recently. This one goes into the “you cannot make this stuff up” category. Twitter (TWTR) took down the meme-sharing accounts created by Planters, a division of Kraft Heinz (KHC) for its new “Baby Nut” mascot which was unveiled during the Super Bowl. Kraft reported that the suspensions occurred despite having consulted with Twitter before the public even knew about Baby Nut. The nut got cut. Zoom Video Communications (ZM) rose nearly 15% yesterday and is now up 28.6% year-to-date as coronavirus fears have investors looking to alternatives in a world increasingly anxious about travel… even to the office in some cases.  Peloton (PTON) and Flywheel Sports have settled their legal disputes over alleged technology theft and patents. Flywheel, which also produces stationary bikes with connected training programs, will stop using the so-called leaderboard technology that Peloton claims to have invented. In exchange for dropping its challenge to the validity of Peloton''s patents, Peloton will dismiss litigation against Flywheel. After today’s US equity markets close, we’ll be hearing from Disney (DIS), which saw the launch of the company''s new streaming platform Disney+ during the quarter being reported. Expectations are for the service to have attracted around 25 million paid subscribers by calendar year-end.  In response to the coronavirus, Disney shuttered its Shanghai theme park indefinitely on Jan. 25, and theaters may remain closed in the region due to the outbreak. Investors will be looking for any clarity on that as well as an update of the companies 2020 and beyond box office schedule. Overnight it was reported Disney will bring Hamilton to the big screen in 2021.  Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) is also expected to report after today''s close with investors looking not only at the top and bottom-line results but also at the growth of digital sales and plans for the company''s drive-through concept dubbed “Chipotlanes.” We’ll also be hearing from Ford, Gilead (GILD), and Royal Caribbean (RCL) - who will likely have to discuss the potential coronavirus impact after yesterday''s revelation that a passenger who had disembarked in Hong Kong from a Carnival (CCL) cruise had tested positive for the virus. For those wanting a deep dive into upcoming earnings, we suggest visiting Nasdaq’s earnings calendar page.  On the Horizon Thoughts for the Day “We cannot change anything unless we accept it.” ~ Carl Jung "Lead me not into temptation; I can find the way myself." ~ Rita Mae Brown Disclosures The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.

Diabetes is quickly becoming one of the most prevalent diseases in the world. Right now, 425 million people around the world are living with the condition, and estimates suggest that number will grow to 629 million by 2045. One promising diabetes stock is Insulet (NASDAQ: PODD), a well-known manufacturer of insulin pumps. While there are a couple of other noteworthy players in this market, Insulet has impressed investors and analysts alike with its consistent and impressive growth figures. Is it enough to warrant a position in your portfolio, though? Let''s look at some of the details and find out. Image source: Getty Images. Insulin pumps help diabetes patients regulate their blood sugar levels by providing consistent doses of insulin throughout the day. Most diabetes patients aren''t currently using insulin pumps, but given the convenience factor, it''s expected that many patients will begin using them in the years to come.  Around 350,000 people in the U.S. are using insulin pumps; 320,000 of them have type 1 diabetes, and the remainder have type 2. Considering the severity of type 1 diabetes patients, whose pancreases are incapable of producing insulin, it makes sense that the majority of early adopters of these pumps fall in this category. However, type 2 diabetes patients can also use these pumps. While 350,000 users may not seem like a massive number right now, the number of patients using these devices is expected to explode over the coming years. In 2018, the global insulin pump market was estimated at around $4.1 billion, but by 2025, it''s predicted it will grow to $16 billion per year. Among other reasons, there''s a pretty big convenience factor that comes with using these pumps. Instead of patients having to inject themselves multiple times per day with insulin, these pumps are low maintenance and do the job for them. Insulet is one of three major competitors in the insulin pump market; the other two companies are Medtronic (NYSE: MDT) and Tandem Diabetes Care (NASDAQ: TNDM). Insulet is known for its OmniPod system, which is the top tubeless insulin pump available right now. The OmniPod is both waterproof and discreet when worn under clothing. Tandem Diabetes'' t:slim X2 insulin pump isn''t waterproof, requires tubing, and is much more conspicuous, so at least for now, the OmniPod is able to distinguish itself from its competitor. The biggest problem for the OmniPod is that it doesn''t feature a continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system like the t:slim does. Dexcom''s CGM system is considered the top system of its kind. Although Insulet''s OmniPod doesn''t come with Dexcom''s monitoring system (whereas Tandem''s t:slim already does), that''s expected to change quickly. Insulet is planning to launch the OmniPod Horizon system later in 2020, which will incorporate the Dexcom monitor to automate insulin dosing for patients. What''s truly impressive about Insulet is its growth over the past few years. In the company''s most recent Q3 2019 financial results, revenue is up 27% from last year, growing from $151.1 million to $192.1 million. Looking further back, 2017 sales came in around $121.8 million, while income in 2016 was $94.9 million. This strong trend of revenue growth is impressive and shows little sign of slowing down. Actual profits, though, are less striking. Net income for the most recent quarter was just $900,000, whereas last year saw net income of $1.7 million. While it''s common for high-growth companies such as Insulet to focus more on growth rather than profit, investors should keep in mind that this stock is barely breaking even despite its growth. However, when we compare financial figures with Insulet''s competitors, primarily Tandem Diabetes, Insulet''s financial figures aren''t that special. Tandem is less than half the size of Insulet and is growing at a much faster rate. Sales shot up by 105% in Q3 2019 to $94.7 million, and while Tandem reported a net loss of $2.9 million, it''s a significant improvement from the $34.2 million loss seen in the previous year. Data sources: YCharts, Insulet, Tandem Diabetes, and Medtronic. YOY = year over year. Despite growing at a slower rate than Tandem, Insulet trades at a pricier premium. Insulet''s price-to-sales (P/S) ratio is currently 18.7, in comparison to Tandem''s 14.8. The only other major player in the insulin pump market, Medtronic, is much larger than either Tandem or Insulet, commanding a market cap of $156.3 billion in comparison to Tandem''s $4.9 billion or Insulet''s $12.7 billion. However, Medtronic''s P/S ratio is just 5.1, substantially cheaper than either of its two competitors (although its revenue is growing at a much smaller pace, so it''s far from a perfect comparison). The point, here, is that Insulet is definitely on the pricier side in comparison to its competitors, and it''s not immediately clear what justifies this premium. While Insulet is technically profitable, it''s also growing slower than some of its rivals, something that is much more important for high-growth companies in such a young market. The reality of the insulin pump market is that there''s plenty of room to grow, and all of the main players in this sector are expecting growth rates to stay strong for quite some time, including Insulet. By all accounts, the company has a very bright future ahead of it. However, compared to its competitors, it might not be the best insulin pump/diabetes stock on the market right now. If I were forced to pick just one stock in this market, I''m not sure Insulet would be it. However, that''s not to say Insulet is a bad company by any means: Strong growth, a competitive product, and a very promising market make this biotech stock a buy in my book.  10 stocks we like better than InsuletWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Moody''s, a leading provider of credit ratings, research, and risk analysis, has been a juggernaut for the past decade, with a total return of over 800% since February 2010, when the stock traded at about $26 per share. Now it''s trading at around $270 per share.  This year, the stock has picked up where it left off, returning almost 15% already as of Feb. 13. On Wednesday, Feb. 5, the company released its fourth-quarter earnings and showed continued momentum. Let''s take a look at where Moody''s is right now and if it''s still a buy. Moody''s is one of the big three credit rating agencies. Image source: Getty Images. As a credit rating agency (CRA), Moody''s rates bonds and an entity''s ability to make payments on its debt. It also has an analytics arm, Moody''s Analytics, which provides economic research and analysis. Moody''s is one of only three major credit rating agencies, along with S&P Global and Fitch. The three control about 95% of the global credit ratings market share. Moody''s and S&P are the two largest, with about 80% of market share, while Fitch has about 15%. Moody''s has long been the leader in this market, building a wide moat protecting its competitive position. It''s not a space that is susceptible to competition due to the simple fact that if there many different rating agencies, it would water down the standard and lead to investors shopping around for a favorable rating. Plus, CRAs are heavily regulated, which is another barrier to entry. In the fourth quarter, Moody''s beat earnings estimates with adjusted earnings per share of $2.00, well ahead of $1.92 consensus estimates. Revenue was up 16% compared to the prior-year quarter, and 9% for the year. Moody''s Investors Service -- the credit rating arm, which generates almost 60% of revenue -- saw revenue jump 21% in the quarter and 6% for the full year. Debt issuance -- bonds issued by commercial or government entities -- was up 18% in the quarter, which is good for Moody''s because it makes money by rating debt issuance. Furthermore, revenue was up 10% for the quarter and 13% for the full year at Moody''s Analytics. Overall, adjusted net income was up 20% for the fourth quarter and 10% for the full year, while operating margin was up 540 basis points -- that is, 5.4 percentage points -- to 40.9% in the quarter. "Moody''s revenue growth for full year 2019 was the result of strong contributions from both Moody''s Analytics and Moody''s Investors Service. Robust performance at Moody''s Analytics was driven by increasing customer demand for core research and data products, along with compliance and know-your-customer solutions. Additionally, Moody''s Investors Service benefited from increased global bond issuance amid generally favorable market conditions," Raymond McDaniel, president and CEO, said in the earnings release. Moody''s guidance for 2020 called for mid-single-digit increases in revenue and expenses. The operating margin is projected to increase to 44%, up from 41% at the end of 2019. Adjusted earnings per share is also expected to rise about 10% to the $9.10 to $9.30 range. There''s no reason to doubt that Moody''s will be a good investment going forward. Debt issuance is expected to increase again in 2020 -- though not at the same rate as last year -- due to expected low interest rates, which is good for Moody''s . Moody''s also gets 40% of its revenue from its analytics side, so it is well diversified if issuance were to slow. In January, Moody''s acquired Regulatory DataCorp (RDC) -- a company that provides data to help companies stay in compliance with anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) regulations. RDC complements Moody''s Bureau van Dijk (BvD) division, which provides compliance solutions. "The addition of RDC''s proprietary data and technology to BvD''s comprehensive company information offerings provides an industry-leading platform that will help customers make better informed decisions as they manage AML and KYC risks and requirements," Dan Russell, executive director of Bureau van Dijk, said in the Jan. 23 announcement. Moody''s price-to-earnings ratio is pretty high due to the company''s strong growth last year. But it''s still a great long-term buy, as market conditions remain good, it has a diversified revenue stream, and it is in no danger of losing its competitive advantage any time soon.  10 stocks we like better than Moody''sWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Chris Hill: Alphabet''s fourth-quarter profits came in higher than expected. Shares of Google''s parent company up a little bit this week, Jason. Overall revenue was light, but there was a lot to like in this quarter. Jason Moser: Yeah, there was plenty to like. I think this was a quarter where they released the YouTube and cloud revenue data for the first time ever. And we were talking in production here, I think, Andy, you were saying something eventually was going to have to happen -- Andy Cross: Yeah, they probably had to do that. Moser: But regardless, I think that''s probably the clearest sign yet, to me at least, they have no intentions of spinning these businesses out from Google/Alphabet anytime soon. I think it really helps offset what is probably one of the bigger points of scrutiny that we hold on the company quarter in and quarter out on the other bets segment. Let''s look at YouTube. Reached $15 billion in ad revenue in 2019; that grew 36% from a year ago. They also ended 2019 at a $3 billion annual run rate in YouTube subscription revenue and other non-advertising revenue. So really, that''s on top of the advertising revenue. That just shows you how big YouTube has gotten at this point. Google Cloud, still performing very well. Ended at a $10 billion run rate for the year. Now, to put that in context, Amazon Web Services chalked up about $10 billion for the quarter. So there''s still plenty of share to capture there. But the good news is that Google Cloud is actually growing at a faster rate than AWS, so they are picking up share, as Ron was talking about last week. But going back to the data on YouTube and the cloud services, they strike a little bit of a defensive tone, it seems, quarter in and quarter out on the call, with the other bets segment. And that''s for good reason. It brought in $659 million in revenue for the year, and it lost better than four and a half billion dollars. [laughs] So there''s clearly a disconnect there. So I understand their defensive tone. But when you now have a light to shine on YouTube and Google Cloud, I think that really takes away from focusing so much on the money that they''re losing in the other bets segment. Cross: Yeah, with Sundar Pichai now the CEO of Alphabet -- who was a former CEO of Google -- he clearly had interest in and knowledge of what was going on with YouTube. So they eventually would have had to disclose the revenues for YouTube. Still, very impressive -- about a $15 billion run rate of revenue. It seems the analysts were expecting a little bit higher, so I think there was some good conversation about, wow, maybe YouTube revenue wasn''t so high, but I agree with you, Jason, on the subscription and other revenues around YouTube. That''s pretty exciting. Ron Gross: Can we start a campaign to change the name back to go Google? Moser: I would much rather -- [laughs] Hill: I''m in. [laughs] Gross: I''m kind of at it. [laughs] Moser: You know, what we''ve not seen a lot in the headlines, you remember they bought a little company called Fitbit recently. While that acquisition has not closed, it''s going to close. And you have to wonder what exactly they plan to do with it. They''re convinced it''s going to add strong capabilities, not only in wearables for them, but it''s going to advance their vision of ambient computing for the Android ecosystem. So ultimately, we''re just going to be walking computers, right? And they feel like Fitbit has a role to serve there. So it''ll be very interesting to see over time how they work Fitbit into their business model. But I think there''s definitely potential there. There''s clearly a market out there for folks who want to wear these devices on the wrist. Whether it''s a watch or a Fitbit or something else. Gross: I say we change the whole company name to Fitbit. Moser: Well, there you go. Problem solved. Hill: Disney off to a solid start in its new fiscal year. The first quarter report was highlighted by the number of subscribers to Disney+, Ron. Gross: Very impressive 28.6 million Disney+ subscribers. Significant increase from the 10 million that they had, the day after it was launched in the U.S. and Canada. It took Netflix about two years to cross that 28 million mark. So nice job, guys, over there. Now has about half the subscribers that Netflix has domestically. We saw good subscriber growth at both Hulu and ESPN as well. Subscribers at Hulu at about 30 million; ESPN+, 7.5 million. So really strong start there. Other divisions, though, are doing really well. Overall revenue for the company up 36%. The parks and experience division up 9%. Studio entertainment, really strong on the heels of The Rise of Skywalker and Frozen 2, Disney''s media unit up 23%. Everybody doing really well. The unit that houses the streaming business reported a loss, which you would expect, because they''re spending lots of money to get this done. Cross: Yeah, and they''re going to continue to have a loss for at least a few years going out. But that''s the real value of what Disney brings, unlike any other company -- certainly, other than Netflix. The value of having that diversified revenue stream with all the different businesses. They can price Disney -- I mean, they priced this exceptionally low, Disney+, exceptionally low. That was, obviously, a huge driver of so many of the subscribers, as well as the content, the brand, of course. But the ability for them to do this, and the fact that they can because they have the other diversified revenue streams, is really an impressive part of the Disney stock story. Gross: Yeah, don''t sleep on Baby Yoda and The Mandalorian, because it is coming back and it''s extremely popular. Moser: It is. We hear a lot of people talking about the price being so low, and when are they going to raise prices? And I actually think it''s going to be a while before they raise prices. And one of the reasons for that is, because right now, they don''t have a lot of new content. I mean, they have a couple of series. All of that Disney content is great, but one thing I will say about that platform, they need to come out with some fresh new content in order to keep people engaged. Until they do that, I think we''ll be able to overlook it, because I''m only paying $6 a month for it. But it all leads me to believe that I don''t know that they''re going to be raising prices on it anytime soon. I would look over the next couple of years for them to build that content library out with new and engaging content, which they just don''t really have a lot of right now. Gross: I probably should note that Shanghai Disney and Hong Kong Disney have been affected by the coronavirus, and there will be a rather significant economic impact to that. It will be short-term, hopefully, and shouldn''t affect the thesis of owning Disney. Hill: Shares of Pinterest up nearly 20% this week. Fourth-quarter profits came in much higher than expected. And, Andy, a strong quarter for Pinterest, but it also seems like they could use a couple more of these. Cross: Yeah, my radar stock from last week, the third quarter, was not nearly as impressive. And they guided for the rest of the year not to be that great. And that''s reversed now, and the stock, as you mentioned, Chris, had a really nice jump after the earnings came out. A really nice quarter; revenues up 46%. International revenues were up more than 200%. About three-quarters of the users are international. But on the revenue-per-user basis, international was far smaller than the U.S. is in general. U.S. revenues up 36%. Monthly active users for the quarter, as total, up 26%; that was an acceleration of the quarter of last year. The growth there, mostly on the international side, up 35%. So the revenue per user is one that I continue to watch. That, for the quarter, was at $1.22. That was up 15%. International, very strong. But the international is only a fraction of the U.S. -- U.S. is at $4 per user; international is only at about $0.21. So, obviously, a lot of interest and a lot of, can they continue to monetize their entire platform? Pinterest''s entire platform? But really, across the 335 million users they have, with so many being international, can they continue to monetize the international asset they have? And if they can, then the stock is going to do pretty well over the next five years. Hill: Pinterest is a $15 billion company. There was a stretch of time where Pinterest looked like an attractive enough business but not a dominant enough business. That it was a potential acquisition target. Fifteen billion, though, it kind of seems like it''s moving out of the range where a big tech company, an Alphabet or someone else, would come in and try to buy them. Cross: They have a really interesting platform, because it''s advertising-driven, although they are pushing more and more toward more direct-to-consumer revenues. They''re going to be launching this verified-merchant program, so you can buy directly from trusted brands. Jason, they have an oncoming augmented-reality service that people can try on, like, say, makeup, for example, and see how they look. So they''re growing this very visual platform, and it''s very impressive. But they really have to monetize it. But I think, generally, someone could still look at this business and say, "Hey, at the right price, that might be an interesting acquisition," if they can monetize that. Gross: Perhaps the newly named Fitbit would be -- [laughs] Moser: Of all of the social platforms, though -- the data out there is pretty clear -- Pinterest is the one that impacts consumer behavior. I mean, people actually make purchasing decisions based on Pinterest more so than any of the other platforms, which is why I''m not surprised that it''s grown the way it has. It seems to me like it would be an attractive acquisition target, more so than just some of these social plays that are just ad plays, you know. Hill: Two video game companies reporting on Friday. Activision Blizzard''s fourth-quarter profits came in higher than expected, pushing the stock to a 52-week high. But Take-Two Interactive stock falling 10% on Friday after a rough third-quarter report. Although, to be fair, Ron, Take-Two Interactive had a tough comp when you think about just how big this quarter was a year ago. Gross: For sure. Let''s take them one at a time. Activision, as you say, much better than expected revenue and profits, although they were down from this time last year, but they were still much better than expected on the heels of huge success of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare. Call of Duty: Mobile installs exceeded 150 million. The company now has 400 million total monthly active users, which is up 15% year over year. Really impressive. Guidance was fine. I''m guessing they''re being conservative here on purpose, because these businesses ebb and flow with kind of the blockbuster releases. But it was fine. They increased their dividend 11%, paid a 2.65% dividend yield, which is a pretty nice dividend for a company in this business. Now we pivot over to Take-Two. Missed estimates for quarterly adjusted revenue. Strong competition just from the likes of Activision Blizzard, Electronic Arts. They did come up against comps of Red Dead Redemption 2 last year, so revenue was actually down 25% and earnings were down 9%. They narrowed their full-year forecast range -- investors never like to see that. And the creative force behind franchises such as Grand Theft Auto and Red Dead Redemption is leaving the company, another reason that investors were not too happy. Hill: Casper, the friendly mattress company, went public on Thursday at $12 a share. The stock ended its first day up more than 10% but on Friday fell below its IPO price. And Andy, this seems like the post-WeWork world that we are all living in. Cross: You guys heard of fintech, adtech? Welcome to sleeptech. This is Casper trying to capitalize on what they call the sleep economy, but really it''s just kind of a snooze. [laughs] Generally, they priced the IPO at $12 per share. That was actually much lower than the initial range, which was somewhere between $17 and $19 share. The investment banks clearly didn''t see the demand out there. It''s an interesting concept, because sleep is so important. We know more and more studies about that. But just, the market has not seen the opportunity. The losses are building. They spent a ton on marketing. They''ve spent more than $400 million over the last four years on marketing. Revenue growth is OK -- 20%-ish to 30%, 40%, somewhere along those lines gross profits. But they''re losing money. And just, you''ve got to think about the growth prospects and the competitive nature of that market. And it''s a very tough spot. Gross: Investors don''t seem to appreciate that, yes, it''s a mattress, but it''s in a box. Cross: Well, they appreciate it. But also, it''s such a competitive space. There are, I mean, literally, probably hundreds of mattress companies out there. Big competitors. They have 60 retail locations. Retail -- not a great spot to be in right now. Hill: Twitter''s fourth-quarter report, just what the doctor ordered. Revenue came in higher than expected, and it was Twitter''s biggest quarter ever for user growth. Moser: Yeah, I mean, it was a good quarter, I was a little bit surprised at the market''s reaction. It does feel like, to your point, we were talking about this earlier -- it feels like we''ve seen this before. We''ve heard this story before. If you just look back at the last quarter, I mean, the stock was hovering around $40. They came out with the earnings report where they had some concerns on their ad tech and guided down a little bit. And the stock got shellacked. And so this is essentially the opposite. It''s the George Costanza quarter. The numbers are pretty good. Monetizable daily active usage grew 21% year over year, and that number is accelerating over the past several quarters, which is great. Eleven percent top-line growth, eh, that''s OK. Nothing to write home about. But they made $3.5 billion for the year in sales and brought in just a little bit under $2 per share. So there''s nothing wrong with that either. You know, it feels like they need to do something more still, you know? Hill: Well, it''s like we were saying about Pinterest. This is nice; let''s do it for a couple of more quarters, and then you''ll really be cooking with gas. Moser: Yeah, and you know they''re calling for a 20% increase in expenses for the year. And they''re going to increase headcounts. So I wonder if they''re not repeating some mistakes made in the past. We''ll see there. But the fact of the matter is that Twitter does have a really very important audience from an information perspective. I mean, they have journalists, politicians, celebrities. I mean, that doesn''t seem like it''s going away. So figuring out a way to keep the platform engaging is going to matter. But I do feel like they have a little bit of a competitive position there and just the nature of the platform. Hill: Shares of Chipotle down slightly this week, despite the fact that same-store sales in the fourth quarter grew more than 13%. Andy, any restaurant would kill for those comps. Cross: Absolutely. Brian Niccol was my CEO of the Year, from our end-of-the-year special in 2019, and just continues to show why he deserves such respect. And his team, Jack Hartung, the CFO. Revenue up 18%. Chris, you mentioned that comparable-store-sale line, up 13.4%. The eighth consecutive quarter of accelerating comp growth. Transaction growth was up 8%. And they got some pricing and mix help that was up 5%. So, really continuing to get it done with operational excellence -- they called that out in the call -- and, really, innovation. Digital sales growth was up 78% and now accounts for 1 in 5 sales at Chipotle, and they are higher margin. So as they continue to push the innovation curve, Chipotle is really seeing the results. Hill: So last fall, Brian Niccol was asked about breakfast, which has been a question for Chipotle for a couple of years now. He said we have no plans to do this in 2020. This week he said the same thing. But it also seems like they''re ready to pull that lever whenever they need to. Cross: Yeah, they could. I don''t think they really have to right now. I mean, they''re innovating what they call Chipotlanes, which is the drive-through. They''re going to open a bunch more of those this year. And they''re just continuing to do what they need to do, coming off a terrible problem with the health -- they''ve just operated really well, and they don''t have to necessarily go to something that they don''t feel comfortable with. Moser: Maybe they got one of those DEFCON charts in the executive suite. So, like, when comps hit 5% or lower, it''s like, all right, everybody, we are getting ready to introduce burrito. Gross: Get the breakfast burrito. [laughs] Hill: Well, and to Andy''s point about the delivery lanes -- that could be part of the master plan, right? If we''re going to move the needle with breakfast, we''re going to move it in a bigger way, if we make it easy for people to just pick up their breakfast on their way to work or wherever they''re going in the morning. And it may just be something they''re rolling out in 2021-2022. Moser: We can only hope. Hill: Yum! Brands ended its fiscal year not with a bang but a whimper. The parent company of KFC, Taco Bell, and Pizza Hut delivered a familiar story in the fourth quarter, Ron, namely that KFC and Taco Bell had positive same-store sales and Pizza Hut did not. Gross: You put ketchup on bread, and that''s what you get, Chris. [laughs] It''s not the best pizza, and the competition is pretty steep, not just from the likes of Domino''s and Papa John''s, but from all the food delivery apps that now allow users to order from a wide variety of restaurants. And Pizza Hut is really suffering in that regard. As you mentioned, KFC and Taco Bell are kind of doing better, so it can offset, KFC comps up 3%, Taco Bell up 4%, but perhaps it would be better to jettison Pizza Hut if they don''t think they can turn this, because it''s been struggling for quite some time now. Hill: I was just going to ask that. I mean, it really seems like we''ve seen this story quarter after quarter. And this is America. A lot of people like pizza. There''s a playbook here for them to turn it around, and if they can''t, yeah, if I''m KFC or Taco Bell, I''m giving the stink eye to everybody at Pizza Hut, because they''re dragging my stock down. [laughs] Gross: Yeah, if it''s not going to be accretive to earnings, if it''s going to consistently be a drag, then something has got to be done. Hill: All right. Jason Moser, Andy Cross, Ron Gross, guys, we''ll see you later in the show for stocks on our radar. The debate on Capitol Hill is heating up over SEC proposals that would impose new requirements on proxy advisory firms and make it harder to submit shareholder proposals. We are days away from the Academy Awards, so for that we turn to our favorite expert in the realm of corporate governance. Nell Minow is the vice chair of ValueEdge Advisors. She is also the film critic known as the Movie Mom. She joins me now from Washington, D.C. We''ll get to the movie business shortly, but let''s start in the boardroom and specifically the SEC and some proposals that are generating a lot of opposition. And as I understand it, these are proposals that would make it harder for investors to challenge corporate management on environmental, social, and governance issues. You filed some comments with the SEC. What is at stake here for investors like you and me? Nell Minow: Oh, the future of capitalism. Nothing important. Hill: Oh, OK, we can move on to movies then. Minow: [laughs] Yeah, you know, what''s odd about this is there''s a sharply divided vote in the commission proposing these rules. You had the Democrats voting in favor of free-market transactions between financially sophisticated buyers and sellers having to do with access to independent research and recommendations on shareholder proposals that are non-binding on the company. So even if they got a 100% vote on a shareholder proposal saying, "Company, pay more attention to climate change," the company can ignore it, and they do. So yeah, the Democrats, supporting the current system. And you had the Republicans coming in like the nanny state saying, "Well, these may be the most sophisticated professionals in the country -- fund managers managing hundreds of millions and sometimes billions of dollars -- but we don''t trust them to know whether they want to subscribe to these publications or not." And the corporations, the CEOs, are putting a ton of money into it. In fact, this week they took out a full-page ad in The Washington Post, clearly the publication of record for individual investors. I don''t know why. Maybe they wanted government people to read it. But they took out a full-page ad in The Washington Post saying that this was absolutely essential. And they''ve hired all kinds of operatives and fake front groups. In fact, it''s been such a disaster that Senator Van Hollen of Maryland told the chairman of the SEC, "You''ve been duped because the seven comments you relied on in your opening remarks on this proposal were all fake. They were all from people who later said that they didn''t know that they had signed comments and that they however did have a son-in-law working on K Street in Washington." So it''s often very fake. It''s so fake that there''s actually a hearing today in Washington on this issue of fake front groups filing comments on government proposals. Hill: It seems like a lot of time and effort, to say nothing of money, on something that''s non-binding. Minow: Absolutely. The two issues that they seem to be the most concerned about are shareholder votes on CEO pay, of which, 98% voted in favor of CEO pay plans last year -- only 2% of companies had a "no" vote. And once again, even those didn''t have to do whatever the shareholder said. And the other issue seems to be climate change, but you can see they''re really having a meltdown over it. They''ve got parallel rule-making going on over at the Labor Department. Hill: We''ll definitely keep an eye on that. Let''s move to Wall Street. Specifically, Goldman Sachs'' CEO, David Solomon, came out recently and said, "Goldman Sachs, which has done a very good bit of business taking companies public," Solomon said, "Goldman Sachs is no longer going to take a company public, unless it has at least one diverse board member." And he said that "in the past four years, IPOs of U.S. companies with at least one woman on the board performed significantly better than those without." First, are you surprised that Goldman Sachs is taking this stance? Minow: I''m not surprised. I am gratified, though. And it does show, from the facts that you just mentioned, that he relied on, that this is 100% a market-driven decision. Whether it''s chicken or the egg, I don''t know. Whether it is their investors respond more positively to companies with diverse boards or whether companies with diverse boards just do better, nobody will ever know. But certainly, the days of the male, pale, and stale boards should be over. Hill: I was a little surprised. Maybe I shouldn''t be, but I was a little surprised at some of the pushback on this proposal -- some cries of tokenism and that sort of thing. Because again, this just seems like, when you run the numbers, this just seems like smart business by Goldman Sachs, particularly when you consider, over the last six months, going back to last summer when we had Uber, and Lyft and then the whole WeWork debacle, that IPOs of the last six months or so have been a little touchy, a little dodgy. And I don''t know, if I''m Goldman Sachs, I want to back IPOs that are going to make me money. Minow: Absolutely. This comes out, by the way, just as a new study about European initiatives to increase board diversity are lagging. And that may be because they were designed to be a little more tokeny. This is definitely a very strongly market-based decision. It is not "this would be nice to do"; it''s "this is essential to do." In an era of #MeToo, in an era of growing numbers of graduates from business schools, growing numbers of executives who are diverse, it just makes no sense from the standpoint of business to ignore those people. Hill: Let''s move on to the business of entertainment. Disney recently reported. They''ve got more than 28 million subscribers to their Disney+ service, which is pretty nice when you consider it just launched three months ago. I know you''re a subscriber. Did that number surprise you, though? Minow: Not at all. Disney went about it 100% right. As you know, they started the same time as Apple TV and they had the great advantage that Apple did not have, of just the world''s greatest content to put on there. They brought back stuff that was guaranteed to please everybody. So they had stuff on there for baby boomers; they had, crucially, stuff on there for the parents of today''s children. So it''s not just that they want to get access to the Disney Jr. content and the Pixar content for their children, they''re bringing back the stuff from the old Disney Channel series from when today''s parents were in elementary school. And of course, they''ve got Star Wars; they''ve got the Avengers. So it makes absolute sense to me that that would be a bonanza. And that''s why I bought more Disney stock before they started it. Hill: Bob Iger, the CEO at Disney, was talking about the Star Wars franchise and said that the short-term priority is television. To what extent do you think Star Wars is, if not tapped out as a movie franchise, it is at least on the back burner for the next three to five years? Minow: Well, some of their Star Wars-related movies have not done as well, particularly the spinoffs. And I think they are looking at what is gone on with their own Marvel characters and also their rival DC characters, which have really transitioned to television so well. And I think they''re seeing that they''re just a lot more opportunities and that there are certain kinds of stories that are better suited for television. The Mandalorian is a perfect example. It is so well done. It is so satisfying, both to hardcore Star Wars fans and to newcomers, that I think that''s very smart. It''s not just Star Wars that''s transitioning to television. It''s pretty much everything. Hill: Before we go to the Oscars, I want to ask you about your friend, the late, great Roger Ebert. I was listening to an interview he had done with The Motley Fool back in 2002. And he was asked about the most negative change in the movie industry during his career. And he said it was marketing. That marketing had taken over for art and that moviemakers were no longer trying to make the Great American Movie. That was nearly 20 years ago that he said this. To what extent do you think marketing has taken over for art when it comes to movies? Minow: I agree with Roger, as I just about always do. I think the turning point for me, going back to Disney, was the year that the original Lion King movie came out. It was at that time the highest-grossing film of the year, which was nice and everybody was happy about that. But I think that what made the real difference is that even at the very, very top of the pyramid of movie box office, they still made more money from merchandising than they did from box office. And I think that really turned movies into infomercials. And I was at a screening of the Birds of Prey movie, which is going to be a big hit this weekend. And somebody came dressed as one of the characters, and she told me that she got the outfit from Spencer Gifts. So, ahead of time, they''re already marketing the costumes for these characters. So I think movies are increasingly being used just to sell merchandise. On the other hand, because of the other issue that we''ve just talked about, which is television and the unquestioned golden age of television, the content that''s available on television right now, you have a whole new category of lower-budget content that would never have found a movie theater in the past. It''s absolutely terrific. It''s a very, very strong fan base and doesn''t have to make $20 million or $100 million to provide an adequate return. Hill: It''s amazing that somehow the Birds of Prey people were able to get their stuff together. But for all the success of The Mandalorian, Disney couldn''t get Baby Yoda toys out before Christmas. Minow: That was shocking, and I suspected it was because they wanted it to be a surprise, and I felt very lucky that I watched that first episode with the surprise at the end without knowing anything about it ahead of time. I had just the purest sense of delight; I laughed out loud when I saw that. And I thought it was perfectly handled, and I wondered if that was why. They were just trying to keep it a secret. Hill: All right, let''s get to the Academy Awards. We''ll stick with the three of the biggest awards, anyway. And as always, I''m going to ask you who should win and who you think will win. And we''ll start with Best Actor. This is Joaquin Phoenix''s fourth time being nominated. And it really seems like the fourth time is going to be a charm for him. Minow: Yeah, I''m afraid you''re right. I wasn''t that crazy about the performance, although you have to admire his commitment. I wasn''t excited about the movie. I think he is going to win. Somebody told me a long time ago, and I didn''t believe it, but I''ve grown to believe it, that the Hollywood voters for the Oscars pay a lot of attention to the acceptance speeches that people give. And if they think it''s going to be an acceptance speech that''s going to really promote their industry, they''re more inclined to vote. And I think Joaquin Phoenix, who has been known as something of an unpredictable participant in these events in the past, has been on his very best behavior. And I think for that reason he''s probably going to win. But my choice would be Adam Driver, not just because he gave a sensational performance in Marriage Story but because what a year that guy had. He was in three very different movies. He was in Star Wars. He has just become one of the most interesting and really varied performers that we have in Hollywood. And I would love to see Adam Driver get the award. Hill: In the Best Actress category, Renee Zellweger appears to be an overwhelming betting favorite. Who do you think will win, and who do you think should win? Minow: Yeah, I think she is going to win. And certainly, again, talk about commitment. She gave a tremendously committed performance in Judy. Which is the story of the last few months of the life of Judy Garland. To me, it was a little stunt-ish. And I think she''s a person who has a lot of affection in the Hollywood community; everybody loves a comeback, all of that. If it were my pick, I would go with Saoirse Ronan, who, first of all, should just get an Oscar every year. She''s the Meryl Streep of her generation, but her performance as Jo March in Little Women was absolutely dazzling. Hill: And finally, eight films nominated in the Best Picture category, but it does seem like it is 1917''s to lose? Minow: You know, I think that''s right. And yet, out of a lot of the preliminary awards that are important indicators, we saw Parasite, Parasite got the Screen Actors Guild Award, their equivalent of Best Picture. It would be stunning for a Korean film to win Best Picture. It would be stunning for any non-English language film, for a horror film, all of those reasons, no-name actors that are known in the United States, and yet it has a lot of support. I''m guessing we may just see a split. We may see Bong Joon-ho get the Best Director. And 1917 gets Best Picture. 1917 is the quintessential Best Picture. It''s a big historical epic that''s just got a lot of heart to it and a lot of technical achievement. Look for Roger Deakins to get the Oscar for cinematography for that; well deserved. Hill: And finally, please fill in the blank, when it comes to the Academy Awards, don''t be surprised if ... ? Minow: I''m going to say, don''t be surprised if Disney does not win Best Animated Film. They usually have a lock on everything, but this is a very crazy year. And I don''t think that Toy Story is going to get it. I think it could go to Missing Link, which is a stop-motion animation. They''ve never had one of those win best animated before. I Lost My Body, a very strange film that nobody saw, but it''s got a lot of support. So I think that''s kind of the wild card category this year. Hill: One of the best reasons to be on Twitter is so you can follow Nell Minow. Get her thoughts on corporate governance, movies, and a lot more. Nell, enjoy the Academy Awards, always good talking to you. Minow: Thank you.

Because that''s how we roll on Motley Fool Money. All right, let''s get to the stocks on our radar. Our man behind the glass, Steve Broido, is going to hit you with a question. Ron Gross, you''re up first. What are you looking at this week? Gross: Empire State Realty Trust (NYSE: ESRT), ESRT. It''s a real estate investment trust that I''m looking into. They went public back in 2013. Their flagship asset is the Empire State Building, which I think we''ve all heard of. About 93% of their assets are office space, 7% retail. Portfolio currently consists of 14 different office properties, really strong management team, decades of experience in Manhattan office real estate. It is a real estate investment trust, a REIT, currently has a 3% dividend yield. Hill: Empire State Realty Trust. Steve, you got a question? Steve Broido: So, in a sentence or two, why should investors buy REITs? Gross: So REITs, by law, have to distribute 90% of their net income to shareholders. So, typically, the dividends are higher than other types of companies. So if you''re looking for yield, that''s a nice place to look. Hill: Jason Moser, what are you looking at this week? Moser: Yeah, putting together a small-cap report for the augmented-reality service, and I am going to feature Limelight Networks (NASDAQ: LLNW) in this report; ticker is LLNW. This is a small-cap, right, about a $600 million market cap, but they are in the business of digital content delivery, and they utilize edge computing to do that. Now what is edge computing, you say, Steve? Well, in simplest terms, it''s just bringing the cloud closer to us and reduces latency as we download and stream more stuff. So it''s a business I''m looking into learning more about. Their customers operate media, entertainment, gaming technology and they have a big customer in Amazon, who accounted for approximately 30% of revenues last year. So I''m trying to ascertain what the competitive advantage is here or if it''s just something that could ultimately be wiped out by big tech. Hill: Steve, question about Limelight Networks? Broido: Seems like a very crowded space. What''s the one thing they can do to stand out? Moser: Well, I think deliver that content as quickly and as vibrantly as possible, right? I mean, when you''re streaming and you''ve got a good picture and zero latency, that really stands out for consumers, I''d say. Hill: I''m not saying it''s on the level of Datadog, but that''s a good name. Limelight Networks, that''s a good name. Moser: Limelight, makes me think of Rush. Hill: Andy Cross, what are you looking at this week? Cross: Steve, one that you might have heard of, Moody''s (NYSE: MCO), symbol MCO. One of the largest credit ratings analysis firms of fixed-income and debt instruments. It has basically a duopoly with S&P, where they have more than 80% market share. It''s a recommendation in our Moneymakers service, because it makes a lot of money, has exceptionally high profit margins, they can price their debt ratings, they can increase the prices 3% to 5% a year. Sales at about 30 times on the earnings front at 11 times sales. So it''s had a magnificent run. Stocks up 70% for the past year. So I''m looking for a little bit of pullback but want to see what they have earnings next week. Hill: Steve, question about Moody''s? Broido: How much should investors rely on these ratings? Cross: Well, if you''re a debt instrument investor -- a lot. I mean they have to buy -- most of them are required to have the debt instruments rated before they can buy them. So I think it''s important to look at them and understand them. Hill: Standard & Poor''s has the 500 Index. How come Moody''s doesn''t have an index? Cross: I don''t know. They probably need one. They do have a little Moody''s Analytics business, which is growing really rapidly. Hill: Not as good as an index. [laughs] Moody''s, Limelight Networks, Empire State Realty -- you got one you want to add to your watchlist there, Steve? Broido: Let''s go to New York, Ron. Gross: All righty, I''m in. Hill: A road trip. Woo-hoo! Will you film that, because I would totally watch a road trip movie with you two. Broido: Absolutely. Hill: All right. Ron Gross, Jason Moser, Andy Cross -- guys, thanks for being here. All: Thank you. Hill: That''s going to do it for this week''s edition of Motley Fool Money.

Both companies make things that people use every day in good economic times and bad. The stocks for each company, backed by scale and brand recognition, have long been viewed as safe havens. Is one a better choice than the other right now? Procter & Gamble boasts a market cap of just about $300 billion. It generates nearly $70 billion in annual sales. The consumer staples giant sells products in over 180 countries around the world and operates in 10 product categories. It is largely focused on personal care products, from diapers to soap to razors. The one thing it doesn''t do is make food.    Image source: Getty Images. Unilever, at a nearly $160 billion market cap, is smaller than P&G, but still a giant company with a similar global reach. It generates around $50 billion in annual sales. The company, based in Europe, operates in many of the same industry segments and countries as P&G, but it also makes food. That is one of the key differences here.  That said, there''s an important difference in the geographic breakdown of each company''s sales. P&G generates roughly 45% of revenues from North America versus about 30% at Unilever. That makes sense, given that P&G is based in the United States. In Europe, Unilever''s home base, the two generate around the same percentage of sales, hovering in the low 20% space. The rest of sales at both companies are generated from regions that, broadly speaking, contain more emerging economies -- with P&G generating around 30% of sales from such areas and Unilever about 45%. That''s a rough estimate. Unilever goes a step further, pulling out all emerging markets regardless of the broader region in which they operate. By its own measure, the European company says it gets about 60% of sales from these often fast-growing nations. Although it''s hard to make an apples-to-apples comparison here, the big picture story is that Unilever has more exposure to markets that are likely to grow more quickly over time.    Looking at each company''s balance sheet, neither one comes off as financially weak. That said, P&G does appear to be on a slightly more solid financial footing. For example, the U.S. consumer goods giant''s financial debt-to-equity ratio is just a touch under 0.10 times, while Unilever''s ratio is a touch over 0.20 times. Both are good numbers, but P&G''s is a bit better. That''s also true when you look at financial debt to EBITDA, where P&G comes in at 2.5 times versus Unilever''s roughly 2.9 times. P&G and Unilever cover their interest expenses by 29 times and 27 times, respectively.   PG Financial Debt to Equity (Quarterly). Data by YCharts It would be hard to suggest that an investor would be taking on materially more financial risk by investing in Unilever over P&G based on their balance sheets. That said, for truly conservative investors, P&G does look like the stronger company here. One interesting difference here is that P&G has been doing a pretty good job of late when it comes to growing its business. After resetting its roster of products a few years ago when it sold a large number of lower-margin brands, the company has started to see top-line growth again. The numbers aren''t huge, with growth in the low to mid-single digits lately, but management has basically come through on its promise after making a bold change in direction by focusing on a smaller number of more important brands.    That said, both companies are dealing with a difficult and competitive market. Using the internet, new entrants can compete more easily with the industry giants. To that end, Unilever has had mixed results, too. But 2019 was, overall, a decent year with core revenue growth in the mid-single-digit space. So it isn''t exactly falling behind.   One notable difference between the two is profitability. P&G''s gross margins are up near 50%, while Unilever''s are closer to 40%. Neither is bad, but in some ways P&G appears to be doing a better job. P&G''s operating margin has historically been better, as well. This makes P&G look like a better-run operation, though it would be difficult to suggest that Unilever is poorly run.   P&G''s stock has advanced around 40% over the past three years, with Unilever up roughly 45%. For reference, the S&P 500 Index is also up around 45%. That said, P&G''s stock was deeply out of favor when it made the call to sell brands a few years ago, but as results started to prove the move was a good call, the stock recovered. Thus, if you start this comparison from May 2018, when P&G''s stock started to turn higher again, the numbers change dramatically. Since that point P&G''s stock is up over 70%, handily beating the S&P''s 27% gain and Unilever''s 10% or so advance. Investors have clearly changed their tune when it comes to P&G.  PG data by YCharts That''s important because P&G is trading above its five-year averages on key valuation metrics, including price to sales, price to earnings, price to cash flow, and price to book value. It''s also trading above its price to forward earnings, which looks at valuation relative to analyst expectations. P&G looks expensive today. Investors with a value bent probably won''t want to buy this stock. The thing is, Unilever isn''t exactly a screaming buy either, though its valuation ratios are more mixed. The European consumer goods giant looks expensive when you examine price to sales, price to earnings, and price to book value versus their longer-term average. However, price to cash flow and price to forward earnings are a bit below their five-year averages. That''s hardly a massive endorsement, but Unilever seems more reasonably valued than P&G today.    This trend follows through to the dividend yields each pays, as well. Unilever is offering investors a roughly 3% yield compared to about 2.4% for P&G. (The S&P 500''s yield, for reference, is below 2% today.) For dividend investors comparing these two, Unilever would probably look like the better option. But, if you add in valuation, even this picture becomes a bit less compelling.  From a big picture perspective, conservative investors probably wouldn''t go wrong with either company. That said, neither P&G nor Unilever really stand out as compelling investments right now. P&G has done a good job of turning its business around after a rough patch, but investors have rewarded it well for that. Unilever has, basically, continued to plod along, which is what you want and expect from consumer goods stocks like these. That said, while it doesn''t look quite as expensive as P&G today, it doesn''t look cheap, either. If you had to pick one of these two, Unilever''s higher yield and less extreme valuation would probably win the day. But, in the end, most would likely be better off sitting on the sidelines here or continuing to look for other alternatives.   10 stocks we like better than Procter & GambleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Harry''s, by contrast, started off as a DTC brand, but expanded into brick-and-mortar retail, and now generates half of its sales through retail partnerships with Target and Walmart. Image source: Getty Images. The FTC said that Harry''s debut in the realm of physical retail stole shelf space from the dominant razor companies, and had the beneficial-to-consumers effect of forcing Edgewell and Gillette-owner Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG) to end their joint practice of annual price increases. Even though Harry''s has a minuscule 2.6% market share, trailing Dollar Shave Club''s 8.5%, the agency calls it a "uniquely disruptive competitor." Razor maker Bic might beg to differ. It previously said it was Edgewell''s own private-label razors that were putting downward pressure on pricing. Still, it was Dollar Shave Club''s audacious arrival on the market that upended the business of how razors were sold. It ceased to be an ever-escalating arms race focused on how many blades could be fit on the head of a razor, and became a battle over which company could offer a reasonably good shave at a low price.  The growing popularity of both Dollar Shave Club and Harry''s compelled Gillette to form its own mail-order razor blade service, and while that might support the FTC''s case that Harry''s should stay independent, Procter & Gamble didn''t view the acquisition as a threat to its dominance. On an earnings call last year, CEO Jon Moeller described the grooming category as competitive, but attractive, and said that Edgewell''s plan to acquire Harry''s wouldn''t change that. That''s an understandable view to take, given that Edgewell only holds a combined 13.6% share of the razor market; even adding Harry''s to its portfolio would have still left it running a distant second to Gillette, which has a 47% market share. With the FTC blocking the deal, however, Harry''s will be unable to access the broad distribution channels Edgewell enjoys; the direct-to-consumer company will have to approach new retailers on a case-by-case basis. Also, Edgewell''s sales have been declining, and in 2019, it posted GAAP losses totaling $353 million. To turn the business around, management has been exploring a strategy of broadening its scope beyond razors and into other personal care products. That plan will be more difficult to execute without Harry''s.    A market with more competitors may be the FTC''s goal, but that doesn''t make them better competitors -- now, both companies are left to battle separately against Gillette and Dollar Shave Club. Since Edgewell has chosen to not challenge the FTC in court, Harry''s has a few options if it wants to scale up further: Finding another buyer would be difficult. The FTC would almost certainly block a purchase by Procter & Gamble or Unilever for the same reasons it opposed the Edgewell deal, though a private-equity firm could make an offer.  Pursuing an IPO is an option, but some might view the poor post-IPO performances of other DTC unicorns like Casper Sleep and Peloton Interactive as an argument against that course. Harry''s has also been through numerous financing rounds so far, raising some $475 million in venture funding. While it would be possible to dip into that market again, it might be more challenging this time, as the odds of a buyout now appear more remote.  Edgewell Personal Care''s plan to buy Harry''s made a lot of sense for both parties. Now, they will be forced to remain separate in competitively disadvantageous positions. That outcome can''t be good for the marketplace.  10 stocks we like better than Edgewell Personal CareWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

While the NFL''s Super Bowl championship game played on Feb. 2 undoubtedly had a lot to do with the amount of money wagered, the state has become the country''s sports betting capital since the Supreme Court struck down the federal law prohibiting wagers on sports in 2018. Now New Jersey is looking to capitalize on that by expanding into esports. Image source: Getty Images. Esports is huge and getting bigger. Data analytics firm Newzoo says esports global revenue surpassed $1 billion in 2019, and viewership is expected to hit 646 million people by 2023, a 9% compound annual growth rate, according to Business Insider Intelligence. Moreover, the biggest names in technology, including Alphabet''s Google, Apple, and Microsoft, are competing for market share for live-streaming esporting events. China''s Tencent is the world''s biggest esports company, generating over $20 billion from the industry, but Sony is quickly gaining ground, while Activision Blizzard and Google are partnering to host esports events in the cloud. In short, esports is a massive opportunity, which is why the gambling industry is naturally attracted to it. New Jersey legislators recently introduced a bipartisan bill to legalize betting on esports, with a few exceptions, such as events sponsored by or affiliated with a high school, or ones where most of the competitors are under 18.  Using the state''s 2018 sports betting legislation, the new law would expand the definition of a sports event to include any skill-based attraction, including awards competitions and even competitive eating contests. (Hey, hot dog eating contests could be big!) The law was previously changed to allow betting on video game tournaments where participants were adults. The gambling enforcement division actually allowed sportsbooks to accept wagers placed on esports'' League of Legends World Championship in Paris that ran from October to November.  Support for the bill is driven by efforts to help Atlantic City survive. The state has been in the forefront of making gambling more accessible, and spearheaded the drive to legalize sports gambling and eliminate Nevada''s monopoly. It was also one of the pioneers in online gambling, which has been fueled by FanDuel, which partnered with the Meadowlands Racetrack, and DraftKings, which partnered with Resorts Atlantic City. Sportsbooks and online gambling sites have to be affiliated with either a physical casino or racetrack.  FanDuel and DraftKings, which recently filed for an IPO, control about 80% of the online market in the state through their partnerships with The Meadowlands Racetrack and Resorts Casino, respectively, though FanDuel is the biggest U.S. sportsbook with a 60% share. Yet only half of the state''s 10 operators in New Jersey were able to report seven-figure sports wagering revenue in January. By expanding the law to include esports, it could make Atlantic City casinos much more popular with millennials.  New Jersey Sports Wagering Gross Revenue-January 2020 Retail Revenue Internet Revenue Total Revenue Bally''s $164,575 $491,164 $655,739 Borgata $723,927 $2,460,264 $3,184,191 Golden Nugget $116,266 $431,643 $547,909 Hard Rock ($4,467) $340,933 $336,466 Harrah''s $107,424 $0 $107,424 Ocean Casino $377,369 $1,963,678 $2,341,047 Resorts Casino $163,436 $15,895,379 $16,058,815 Tropicana $100,288 $74,379 $174,667 Meadowlands Racetrack $4,275,047 $22,197,511 $26,472,558 Monmouth Racetrack $883,716 $2,799,094 $3,682,810 Data source: NJ Division of Gaming Enforcement. Table by author. Gambling at physical casinos appeals to an older demographic, but the group of gamblers who most often bet online are between the ages of 25 and 34, and make up over 35% of the total. In contrast, the average age of esports players ranges from around 21 for League of Legends to about 25 for Super Smash Bros. Melee. The average age of esports viewers is 28, which might be older than you''d suspect, but in comparison to major league sports championship games, where the average viewers are in their 40s, these are young whippersnappers. They also have money to burn, with an average income of $50,000 or more. Esports betting is the next logical progression, and New Jersey could be a pioneer once again if it passes this bill. It has bipartisan support in the lower house of the legislature, and the state''s gambling regulator fully supports its passage.  Because online gambling is the only real growth channel in New Jersey, extending the law to esports, which may then find more tournaments hosted in Atlantic City (the first one was held at Caesars Resorts casino in 2017), could be a major growth opportunity.  10 stocks we like better than Tencent HoldingsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

It expects its revenue to fall 8%-10% annually for the quarter, and decline 18%-19% for the full year. Analysts had expected its revenue to decline 4% for the quarter and 17% for the year. On the bottom line, Turtle Beach expects its EPS to decline 44%-52% for the quarter and 82%-85% for the full year. Both estimates were in-line with analysts'' expectations, but those numbers are ugly, and the fact that the company met earnings expectations while missing revenue estimates suggests that it''s cutting costs to boost its earnings. However, CEO Juergen Stark noted that Turtle Beach faced tough year-over-year comparisons due to "an extraordinary surge" in headset sales in 2018 and that its revenue declines in 2019 were "anticipated." But looking ahead, Stark expects its sales to accelerate again as Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Sony (NYSE: SNE) launch new consoles later this year, and he predicts that the gaming headset industry would "return to growth in 2021." Image source: Turtle Beach. Analysts seem to share that sentiment, with the average forecasts calling for 4% revenue growth and 35% earnings growth next year. Based on those estimates, Turtle Beach trades at just 11 times forward earnings -- which suggests it''s an undervalued stock primed for a rebound. Should investors take a chance on this battered stock, or is it still a falling knife? Turtle Beach''s revenue rose 7% in 2016, declined 14% in 2017, then surged a whopping 93% in 2018. That massive acceleration was fueled by the explosive growth of "battle royale" games like PUBG and Fortnite, which encouraged players to communicate via headsets. Turtle Beach launched the first wireless gaming headsets for the Xbox One just as the boom started in the second half of 2017, and it reaped the rewards throughout 2018. Turtle Beach became the dominant gaming headset maker in North America, but its growth decelerated for three reasons. First, the growth of battle royale games decelerated. Meanwhile, Microsoft, Sony, Logitech (NASDAQ: LOGI), Razer, and other companies saturated the market with similar wireless gaming headsets, causing Turtle Beach''s market share in North America to dip from 45.7% in 2018 to 43.4% in 2019, according to NPD. Lastly, upgrade cycles for gaming headsets were long, and gamers generally didn''t need new ones unless the old ones broke. Image source: Epic Games. That slowdown prompted Turtle Beach to acquire PC accessory maker ROCCAT last June. It claimed that the acquisition would reduce its dependence on cyclical headset sales, but ROCCAT''s core products -- which include gaming keyboards, gaming mice, and other peripherals -- are all heavily commoditized. The strategic shift transformed Turtle Beach from an exciting growth stock to a smaller version of Logitech, which also sells a diverse portfolio of PC and console accessories. But in a head-to-head comparison, Logitech seems like the better investment because its larger and more diversified business is less vulnerable to competition and cyclical downturns. If you believe that sales of Turtle Beach''s headsets will pick up again as the PS5 and Xbox Series X hit the market later this year, then its stock is clearly undervalued. Unfortunately, that rosy outlook glosses over a few major headwinds. Turtle Beach enjoyed a first mover''s advantage back in 2017. However, Sony, Microsoft, Logitech, Razer, SADES, and other companies have since woken up and will likely launch new wireless gaming headsets for consoles and PCs this year. Battle royale games remain popular, but they''re growing at a slower pace and unlikely to boost headset sales again. Turtle Beach expects ROCCAT to boost its 2020 revenue by at least $30 million (13% of its projected sales) and be accretive to its earnings. But realistically, ROCCAT could struggle to stand out in the crowded market -- forcing Turtle Beach to ramp up its marketing spend and throttle its earnings growth instead. In short, I believe that investors shouldn''t put too much faith in Turtle Beach''s forward valuations. Instead, they should wait for a clearer full-year outlook when it reports its fourth-quarter earnings in mid-March.  10 stocks we like better than Turtle BeachWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

According to a report from Bloomberg, certain components are pushing up the costs for Sony''s upcoming PlayStation 5 game console.  While some tech specs have surfaced, neither company has finalized all specs for their respective game machines, and that means pricing is still up in the air. The console manufacturers seem to be playing cat-and-mouse on who can deliver the best technology at the lowest price, which could have implications on who wins the next console war. Image source: Getty Images. The problem for Sony appears to be short supply for DRAM and NAND flash memory, which are in high demand as smartphone manufacturers gear up for new launches this year. The PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X are expected to feature solid-state storage drives, which rely on flash memory chips. Technology experts believe that flash memory prices could jump by 40% in 2020. Bloomberg reports that most of the components for PlayStation 5 are "locked down," but Sony executives are being patient on the console''s pricing and may wait until Microsoft sets the price for Xbox Series X before making a final decision. That may not come until at least the E3 gaming expo in June.  Both the Xbox One and the PlayStation 4 launched at $399 in 2013. Consoles are typically sold at or above breakeven. The PS4 has outsold Xbox One by about two-to-one, so maybe Sony can get away with a slightly higher price if needed. The costs for each PS5 are currently estimated to be up to $450.   10 stocks we like better than SonyWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

So it may be worthwhile looking at the stocks that did the best in 2019, rather than the contrarian "dogs" of last year. Semiconductor manufacturing equipment supplier Lam Research (NASDAQ: LRCX) was the second-best performing stock in the S&P 500 last year, but sold off hard with the rest of its sector at the end of last week. And that''s in spite of a really impressive earnings report delivered on Jan. 29, which not only beat analyst expectations across the board, but also gave impressive guidance for the current quarter -- even while factoring in potential coronavirus disruption.  Image source: Getty Images. Ironically, though Lam Research''s stock more than doubled, it saw earnings per share and free cash flow decline in calendar 2019. Chalk it up to Lam proving it can weather a vicious semiconductor down-cycle much better than investors had feared. Though Lam saw non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) EPS decline from $17.44 per share in calendar 2018 to $14.51 in 2019, last year wound up being the second-best year in Lam''s history, and its earnings decline was pretty mild by industry standards.  Lam is a main player in equipment that makes memory modules, especially today''s stacked NAND flash chips. As many know, late 2018 and most of 2019 saw plunging prices for both NAND flash and DRAM memory. Total DRAM industry revenue fell 37.5% in 2019 on a 47.7% price decline, and NAND flash sales declined 23.1% on a milder fall in ASP, as its downturn started earlier than DRAM''s. Thus, basically all of the main memory and storage players cut back significantly on capital expenditures, which means fewer purchases of Lam''s equipment. It''s impressive Lam only saw its earnings per share decline 16.8% for the year, when many of its clients saw earnings plummet by greater orders of magnitude. There were a few reasons its financials held up so well: 1. Foundry and logic saved the day: Though Lam''s memory sector clients were in freefall, its foundry and logic customers stepped up in a big way. That''s because 2019 saw a surge in demand for both 5G and high-performance computing chips with smaller form factors and greater power efficiency. Leading chip foundry Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) reacted by increasing its capital expenditures by a whopping 40% in 2019 to increase its leading-edge chip supply, an unexpected benefit for all equipment suppliers, including Lam.  2. Servicing its installed base: When companies don''t buy new equipment, they need their old equipment to run more efficiently. Though new equipment purchases fell year-over-year, Lam''s installed base grew from 56,000 to 61,000 in 2019, a 9% increase. On the recent conference call with analysts, Lam management said that its productivity upgrades and solutions services business grew 30% last year. Management doesn''t break out how much of its revenue comes from services, but it did say that it was "comfortably above 30% in 2019."  So even in a down year for new equipment sales, Lam was able to blunt the impact by continuing to grow its services business. That should definitely even out further down cycles. 3. Huge buybacks: Finally, Lam''s earnings per share also benefited from aggressive share repurchases. In 2019, the company bought back $3 billion in stock. That was even more than its free cash flow, but Lam is fortunate to have a highly profitable business and solid balance sheet, with $4.9 billion in cash and equivalents against only $4.4 billion of debt and finance lease obligations.  The aggressive buybacks lowered the average share count by about 7.5%, adding further fuel to EPS.  Lam gave more than encouraging guidance for the current quarter, with revenue, gross margin, operating margin, and non-GAAP EPS, all above last quarter''s results. And that guidance included some caution around the coronavirus. Management sees the wafer fabrication equipment industry growing from $46 billion to 47 billion in 2019 to the "mid- to high $50 billion range" in 2020.  That roughly 20% increase will come from continued strength in foundry and logic, even after the strong 2019, as well as a return to NAND flash spending, with DRAM following behind NAND. Lam is probably right to be bullish on NAND in the second half of the year; some analysts have even predicted a 40% surge in NAND pricing in 2020.  Despite this undeniably bullish report, Lam''s stock still sold off at the end of last week over coronavirus fears, and it currently trades at less than 15 times next year''s earnings estimates. If the virus does spread more than feared, it could very well delay some purchases and slow down China''s economy -- an important region for Lam, accounting for 29% of revenue. However, any delays should be just that -- delays. Barring a worldwide recession, there''s a strong imperative for companies and countries to utilize leading-edge chips for 5G and artificial intelligence applications, which means Lam''s products should be in demand for a long time. Though Lam outperformed in 2019, semiconductor equipment stocks still remain some of the cheapest stocks in the technology sector. With management guiding for sequential growth even while incorporating the coronavirus headwinds, Lam looks like a strong pickup for the Foolish long-term investor on the coronavirus-fueled sell-off.  10 stocks we like better than Lam ResearchWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

That market reaction might seem counterproductive at first glance, because the tower and back-end networking businesses are watching two of their largest customers boiling down to a single entity -- fewer clients should equal lower sales, right? But the reaction actually does make sense. Here''s how. The heavy hitters behind the scenes of America''s mobile networks all made significant gains on Tuesday: Company Max Price Change 2/11/20 52-Week Price Change Market Cap American Tower (NYSE: AMT) 6.1% 47% $108 billion Crown Castle International (NYSE: CCI) 6.9% 35% $64 billion SBA Communications (NASDAQ: SBAC) 8.5% 54% $30 billion Uniti Group (NASDAQ: UNIT) 9% (60%) $1.4 billion Data sources: Yahoo! Finance and YCharts. The three cell tower specialists have been beating the market over the past year (and five years, and 10) while Uniti is making up for some lost ground today. As a network infrastructure manager whose largest client and former parent company is going through bankruptcy, Uniti plays a relatively small part in the wireless market. Roughly 1.2% of Uniti''s revenues came from tower leases in the third quarter of 2019, down from 1.7% in the year-ago period. So why is it good for these companies that the Sprint and T-Mobile merger is moving ahead? I''ll let their own executives do the talking. Image source: Getty Images. "While there may be some decommissioning of sites as the new T-Mobile optimizes its network and rolls out 5G, we would also expect significant demand from the combined company for our extensive US portfolio during that process and well into the future," said American Tower CEO Jim Taiclet in last year''s second-quarter earnings call. "Furthermore, DISH (NASDAQ: DISH) is set to acquire Sprint''s prepaid business and has made a commitment to deploy facilities based 5G broadband network capable of serving 70% of the U.S. population by June of 2023." So American Tower expects the post-merger version of T-Mobile to step up its infrastructure investments in order to support its 5G network plans. That positive effect should be larger than the reduction of overlapping network installations. Oh, and don''t forget that the companies had to promise to keep the dream of four major competitors alive, spinning out Sprint''s Boost Mobile operations to DISH Network. For the record, DISH shares rose as much as 12.6% on Tuesday. DISH would rely on T-Mobile''s infrastructure for up to seven years, but the brand-new carrier might also want to build out its own wireless network over time. "When you listen to Sprint and T-Mobile talk about the rationale for the merger, and you listen more broadly to all of the players in the space, the capital spending is going to start to transition here in the next 18 to 24 months from largely being focused on 4G to 5G," Crown Castle CEO Jay Brown said in his third-quarter 2019 earnings call. "Those activities will start in the next 18 to 24 months really in earnest. This is going to be a decade-long, we believe, investment cycle that will go through with the carriers." Brown largely avoids talking about specific customers in these calls but he does see the Sprint deal as a stepping stone in the larger megatrend of massive 5G installations and the closely related explosion of 5G-based Internet of Things devices. Closing that deal would effectively fire one of many starting guns in that race. "There has been some slowdown since the first half of the year and the activity of T-Mobile, Sprint, and DISH as they await certainty around the outcome of the T-Mobile, Sprint merger and their future paths," said SBA CFO Brendan Cavanagh in the company''s third-quarter 2019 call. "This is logical and to be expected given the circumstances. We expect an immediate escalation in activity once the outcome of the merger becomes clear and long-term network decisions can be made with certainty." In other words, a generous handful of major players in the wireless networking space have been investing a lot less in infrastructure upgrades than they would have if the Sprint deal had been settled -- in either direction. "Overall, we view the potential merger as a long-term positive for Uniti, as the network investments of the combined company appear to be an increase over each company''s investments as a stand-alone entity," said Uniti CEO Kenny Gunderman in last year''s second-quarter call. "The commitment by T-Mobile and Sprint to invest substantially in rural broadband, and in the rollout of 5G services, would be a great fit for our overall strategy and network. We also view the possibility of DISH, becoming a major facilities-based provider as a positive." I hear solid echoes of SBA Communications'' arguments here. Uniti hopes to become a significant provider of towers and back-end network capacity for DISH as that company navigates the wireless markets. All four of these companies are actively rooting for Sprint and T-Mobile to close their merger after two years of grueling uncertainty. If they somehow manage to stumble right at the goal line, that''s still better than not knowing at all, but the proposed deal structure looks like a better outcome for the infrastructure companies. And that''s why they all rose on Tuesday.  10 stocks we like better than American TowerWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

We use 4G today but 5G is touted to be up to 100 times faster than 4G. This new technology is important because it can revolutionize the way we work, play, and live. It can revolutionize our homes (Internet of Things), schools (remote learning), offices (automation), shops (personalized retail), factory floors (robotics and automation), and hospitals (remote real-time diagnosis and treatment).  It can also revolutionize the way we communicate, travel (through autonomous vehicles), and consume entertainment (allowing us to download movies to our cellphones in seconds and enjoying augmented reality and virtual reality). 5G is able to enable hyper-connectivity between gadgets, machines, and people in countless permutations and combinations, and it can transform societies, cities, countries, and the world. All of this is done through a combination of greater wireless capacity, ultra-fast connection, and data transmission speeds, with minimal time lag or latency.  Image Source: Getty Images. The roll-out of 5G could be a decade-long process, and it will have a huge and wide-ranging impact. Consulting firm McKinsey reports that every second 127 devices are connected to the internet. The number of Internet of Things (IoT) devices is projected to increase from 7 billion in 2018 to 22 billion by 2025. Leading research firm Gartner predicts that by the end of 2020, there will be 26 times as many connected things as there are humans. And MIT Technology Review believes that between 2020 and 2035, the contribution of 5G to the global gross domestic product (GDP) will be close to the size of India''s economy today, a total of $2.7 trillion.  How can you potentially profit from the 5G boom? Here are five smart ways.  This refers to companies like American Tower (NYSE: AMT), Crown Castle, and SBA Communications, all of which are real estate investment trusts (REITs). They rent out space on cell towers to cellphone carriers to mount their antennas, small cells, and other wireless equipment. Leasing out space on cell towers is attractive because of modest construction costs, low maintenance costs, the non-cancellable nature of the leases, and decent leasing income. The increasing adoption of 5G will result in increased data transmission and consumption, translating into sustained profit growth for the cell tower landlords. Among the cell tower landlords, American Tower Corporation stands out for several compelling reasons, including its size, global presence, long-term growth opportunities, consistent incremental growth in revenue and cash flows, high operating margins, and low maintenance capital expenditures.  Between 2014 and 2019, American Tower''s operating revenues grew by approximately 80% to $7.4 billion, its net income grew by 57% to $1.2 billion, and its dividend per common share grew from $1.40 to $3.15. That''s the kind of across-the-board growth that investors like to see.  Cell phone carriers are expected to enjoy sustained enhanced profits from the introduction of 5G because customers will have to pay more for services. Choosing among the four better-known carriers in America, namely AT&T (NYSE: T), Verizon (NYSE: VZ), T-Mobile, and Sprint, for 5G investing isn''t easy. However, AT&T and Verizon are the biggest among the carriers, and they appear to be competitively positioned.  I like AT&T over Verizon for one main reason. Last September, activist investor Paul Singer''s Elliott Management purchased $3.2 billion of AT&T stock. Elliott Management then sent an open letter to AT&T''s board that noted among other things that its large investment reflected a deep conviction in AT&T''s "extraordinary value opportunity" and that the firm believed that "AT&T can achieve $60+ per share of value by the end of 2021." My view is that Elliott Management is likely to succeed in holding AT&T''s feet to the fire, producing enhanced performance and solid profit growth. Core technology companies include companies manufacturing or enhancing core wireless networking technologies for 5G, such as semiconductor manufacturers, cellular networking and satellites, hardware and software (including testing and bandwidth optimization), enhanced mobile broadband modems, and new radio technology. These companies include Skyworks Solutions, Qorvo, and Qualcomm. Because there are so many core technology companies that will likely compete in the 5G market, I think investors could be better off buying an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that''s focused on 5G rather than buying individual stocks. ETFs to consider include The Defiance 5G Next Gen Connectivity ETF and First Trust Indxx NextG ETF. The former looks more attractive because of its lower expense cost of 0.30% vs. 0.70% for the First Trust ETF. There are several companies that sell smartphones, wearables, and home technology, but none of them matches up to Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL). Apple is an American innovation juggernaut that has revolutionized consumer technology. Riding the coattails of Apple to profit from 5G is a smart idea because you are investing in one of the best management teams, corporate employers, and technology innovators in the world, with eye-popping profitability and a fortress-like balance sheet. Most importantly, your investment will benefit not only from Apple''s forthcoming 5G iPhones but also from its forays into other promising areas including healthcare, autonomous driving, and satellites. NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) is arguably one of the most respected technology companies in the world today, pioneering technologies necessary to transform science fiction into reality. In October 2019, NVIDIA unveiled Aerial, a software development kit (SDK) for telecom operators building 5G wireless Radio Access Networks (RANs). Aerial helps telecommunications companies offering 5G Networks to optimize wireless networks and AI models "running at the edge." These telecom companies can use the same computing infrastructure required for 5G networking to provide AI services for smart cities, smart factories, smart healthcare, augmented reality/virtual reality (AR/VR), and cloud gaming. With Aerial, NVIDIA has made a strategic foray into the 5G wireless market. NVIDIA''s partnership with industry leaders like Ericsson, Red Hat and Microsoft will help it deliver an end-to-end solution to telecom companies.  I think that the speed, capacity, reliability, versatility, and multi-functionality of NVIDIA''s platforms promise to enhance the deployment of 5G, making it truly transformative. This stock is truly a jack of all trades, but instead of being a master of none it''s a master of them all.  10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

However, net revenues remained relatively stable, thanks to 10% (y-o-y) growth in recurring revenues from non-trading segments. Notably, Nasdaq’s technology solutions business observed a 25%(y-o-y) growth, driven by the company’s acquisition of Cinnober even as it continued to grow deal volumes. Trefis highlights the key sources of Nasdaq’s revenues in an interactive dashboard along with our projections for 2020. While the Market Technology segment accounts for less than 10% of Nasdaq’s top line as of now, the segment can potentially grow at an annual rate of up to 10% over the coming years to double in size by 2025.

This drop gave back some of the stellar gains the company had to close out 2019, when shares rose 44% in November and another 10% in December. While there wasn''t any real news for Trupanion in January, there''s good reason to believe that some of the gains in 2019 resulted from a mini short squeeze. Therefore, January''s drop is attributable to a decrease in the temporary demand created when short sellers covered their positions. Image source: Getty Images. Trupanion blew past estimates when it reported third-quarter 2019 earnings in November. Total quarterly revenue grew 27% to $99.3 million. But earnings per share (EPS) was the real surprise. Analysts expected a $0.02 loss, but the company reported a $0.02 EPS gain. That must have shocked traders, as around 35% of shares were sold short at the time. Seasoned investors have likely seen higher short interest before, but 35% is particularly potent for Trupanion. That''s because the stock has low volume. When volume is low for a stock, it takes longer to cover a short position. Because of Trupanion''s low volume and high short interest, days to cover peaked at a whopping 56.8 in December, according to data from Nasdaq. The amount of shares sold short steadily decreased in November and December, before bottoming out in the first half of January. Trupanion''s stock didn''t fall throughout January, but rather dropped from Jan. 8 to Jan. 10. Short interest data is released twice a month. Data on Jan. 15 showed short interest in Trupanion began increasing again during the first half of January -- coinciding with stock''s drop. This indicates that demand for the stock increased while short sellers were covering at the end of 2019, but the temporary demand created by short sellers ended sometime in the first half of January. I want to be clear that not all of Trupanion''s gains in 2019 are attributable to a short squeeze. To the contrary, the company reported solid results that beat expectations. That''s genuine reason for long-term investors to remain bullish and not be distracted by temporary volatility. Indeed, the stock has already recovered 8% from January lows, as investors await this high growth company''s fourth-quarter earnings on Feb. 13.  10 stocks we like better than TrupanionWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

For more details on this strategy, click here About Peter Lynch: Perhaps the greatest mutual fund manager of all-time, Lynch guided Fidelity Investment''s Magellan Fund to a 29.2 percent average annual return from 1977 until his retirement in 1990, almost doubling the S&P 500''s 15.8 percent yearly return over that time. Lynch''s common sense approach and quick wit made him one of the most quoted investors on Wall Street. ("Go for a business that any idiot can run -- because sooner or later, any idiot probably is going to run it," is one of his many pearls of wisdom.) Lynch''s bestseller One Up on Wall Street is something of a "stocks for the everyman/everywoman", breaking his approach down into easy-to-understand concepts.

But, at this point in time, I canÃ¢ÂÂt blame anyone for saying it feels like the sky is falling. ThereÃ¢ÂÂs the coronavirus outbreak in China, which keeps getting worse by the day and has already infected more than twice as many people as the SARS outbreak of 2002/03 (and that outbreak hit the global economy pretty hard). U.S. Presidential Donald Trump is going through an impeachment trial Ã¢ÂÂ a rarity in U.S. political history. Not too long ago, the U.S. launched a strike that killed one of IranÃ¢ÂÂs top generals, and now, Middle East tensions are escalating. Meanwhile, Britain has officially left the European Union. Interest rates, which are historically a somewhat good gauge of investor confidence in the economy, are at or near record lows everywhere. The interest rate yield curve in the U.S., which tends to predict recessions, just inverted, again. Does all of this mean that the global economy is headed for a recession and that the stock market is due for a correction? No. On the contrary, I actually think economic conditions will improve in 2020, thanks to easing monetary policy across the globe and easing U.S.-China trade tensions. I also think stocks will do just fine. But, it does mean that thereÃ¢ÂÂs a lot of noise, volatility and instability in global markets, and that traditionally stable fixed income markets wonÃ¢ÂÂt offer investors a lot of yield. Against that backdrop, stable and high-yield utility stocks become quite attractive. With that in mind, letÃ¢ÂÂs take a look at five utility stocks to buy for stability in an unstable market.    One of my favorite utility stocks over the past few years has been American Electric Power (NYSE:). The electricity services provider, which services 5.4 million customers across 11 states, has successfully leveraged customer expansion and stable demand drivers to spark sustained strong revenue and profit growth. Big share price gains have followed suit. Over the past three years, AEP stock is up more than 60%. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs a huge gain for a utility stock. This will all continue for the foreseeable future. The U.S. economy is on solid footing. U.S. consumers are on especially solid footing. So long as that remains true, they will continue to pay up for electricity services, which will help American Electric Power sustain healthy profit growth. At the same time, investors will increasingly seek to play defense as market instability rises, and when they do, most of them will likely turn to AEP stock, given its long history of sustained profit and share price gains. Meanwhile, the stock has a 2.7% dividend yield. That big yield looks quite attractive next to the 10-Year Treasury yield of 1.5%. Given broader market instability, itÃ¢ÂÂs unlikely the 10-Year Treasury yield rises much anytime soon. So, as investors look for yield elsewhere, they will likely run into AEP stock and its stable 2.7% yield.    Another one of my favorite utility stocks to buy when the market starts showing signs of instability is Sempra Energy (NYSE:). Sempra is a multi-faceted energy company that provides energy services to more than 40 million customers globally across Southern California, Texas, Chile and Peru. Inherently, this positions the company for stable operating results, because of its huge size and focus on delivering must-have resources. But, Sempra is selling its Peru and Chile businesses, and expanding its Mexico business. In so doing, Sempra is becoming more stable with better growth prospects than ever, because: 1) Peru and Chile are volatile economies relative to California and Texas and 2) Mexico is one of the more rapidly growing economies in the world with a growing need for energy infrastructure. Investors like this transition. In 2019, SRE stock was up 39%. This transition will continue in 2020. I donÃ¢ÂÂt see any reason why investors will stop liking it. The numbers will remain good. The dividend will remain big around 2.4%. And, above all else, the stock should keep powering higher.    One utility stock that should also provide attractive stability to weather broader market volatility is electric power and gas utility giant Duke EnergyÃÂ (NYSE:). Much like the other names on this list, DukeÃ¢ÂÂs operations are stable and healthy. They provide electricity, gas and commercial renewable services across multiple states. Demand for these services is largely unwavering. So long as the U.S. economy remains on solid footing Ã¢ÂÂ which it should for 2020 Ã¢ÂÂ then DukeÃ¢ÂÂs revenues and profits will move higher. At the same time, so long as interest rates remain low Ã¢ÂÂ and they should for 2020 Ã¢ÂÂ then Duke will have low interest expenses to service its debt, and a relatively high dividend yield, which will appear increasingly attractive to income-seeking investors. All in all, so long as rates remain low and the U.S. economy remains on solid footing, DUK stock should keep powering higher.    Up 45% over the past year and 140% over the past five years, water service provider American Water Works CompanyÃÂ (NYSE:) has been one of the best performing utility stocks in the both the near and long term. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs because this company has strong and stable fundamentals, with strong and stable growth drivers. American Water provides waters services to 15 million people across 46 states and Canada. That makes American Water the largest and most diverse publicly traded water company. Because consumers will forever need water, regardless of broader economic conditions, this positioning as the largest water company makes American Water one of the more stable utility stocks in the market. But, thatÃ¢ÂÂs not why AWK stock is up so much over the past few years. Instead, itÃ¢ÂÂs up so much because there is a huge opportunity for American Waters to sustain 7% to 10% annual profit growth through upgraded plumbing. That is, most water pipes in the U.S. are old, inefficient and need to be upgraded, and American Water is rapidly upgrading this water infrastructure. As they continue to do so over the next few years, American WaterÃ¢ÂÂs revenues, profits and stock price will all move higher.    Much like American Water Works, leading renewable energy and battery storage company NextEra EnergyÃÂ (NYSE:) has been a huge out-performer in the utility stocks category over the past few years, with NEE stock up 50% over the past year and 145% over the past five years. The growth story at NextEra Energy is pretty simple. Technological advancements are pushing renewable energy costs down by a ton, with energy storage costs having . As renewable energy costs have come down Ã¢ÂÂ and as social pressures to Ã¢ÂÂgo greenÃ¢ÂÂ have risen Ã¢ÂÂ demand for renewable energy has skyrocketed. This has led to a big boost in NextEraÃ¢ÂÂs revenues and profits, because the company is a leader in deploying renewable energy. Going forward, as demand keeps rising, more resources will be invested into driving renewable energy costs down even further. As costs keep coming down, demand will keep rising, leading to more resources being invested into driving costs lower. Lather, rinse, repeat. This virtuous growth cycle will power sustained big growth in NextEraÃ¢ÂÂs revenues and profits for the foreseeable future. As it does, NEE stock will keep rising, too.

Investors accepted significant losses in the present on the premise that these would translate to incredible market share in the future. The environment of easy money created many questionable valuations (see: WeWork), and even rare instances of outright fraud (see: Theranos).  But the market shifted in 2019. Investors are thinking more objectively about the stories presented by start-ups and emerging companies, and are much more interested in profitable growth, or at least progress toward it, than empty promises of a big payoff down the road. While tech companies such as WeWork, Uber, Slack Technologies, and others have been hit by this newfound skepticism, even swearing off the growth-at-all-costs mantra of years past, the field of synthetic biology has yet to (publicly) face its reckoning. If and when it does, Twist Bioscience (NASDAQ: TWST) might be the first to fall.  Image source: Getty Images Twist Bioscience wields the leading technology platform for synthesizing DNA, which can be used in genetic engineering experiments to create reference probes for DNA sequencing applications and to store digital data. The company is often associated with synthetic biology, or engineered biology, which is the intentional design of living technologies with reproducible functionality. The company recently reported fiscal first-quarter 2020 operating results for the three-month period ending Dec. 31, and announced it had settled a long-standing legal dispute with Agilent Technologies. The settlement avoided a costly jury trial, but cost the synthetic DNA pioneer $22.5 million. Investors were just pleased to be rid of the headache, and to have removed the largest source of uncertainty hanging over the stock. Shares soared on the announcement. The immediate interpretation of this event is that the settlement will allow Twist Bioscience and Wall Street to focus entirely on growth and financial performance. A deeper dive, however, suggests investors might want to be careful what they wish for. While the company touts impressive growth in revenue and gross profit, that means little when losses attributed to shareholders are growing even faster in absolute dollar amounts. Operating losses have now grown sequentially for eight consecutive quarters.  Metric Fiscal Q1 2020 Fiscal Q1 2019 Change (YoY) Revenue $17.2 million $11.5 million 49% Gross profit $3.3 million ($0.4 million) N/A Operating expenses $59.2 million $22.5 million 163% Operating expenses excluding Agilent settlement $36.7 million $22.5 million 63% Operating income ($55.8 million) ($22.9 million) N/A Operating income excluding Agilent settlement ($33.3 million) ($22.9 million) N/A Data source: Twist Bioscience press release. YoY = Year over Year. When the Agilent legal settlement is excluded, normal day-to-day operations resulted in fiscal first-quarter 2020 operating expenses of $36.7 million. That was $14.2 million greater than in the year-ago period, which easily offset the $3.7 million improvement in gross profit in that span. Swelling losses have had a real impact on shareholders: dilution. Twist Bioscience has tapped into the public markets multiple times since conducting its initial public offering (IPO) in late 2018, including an offering in late January that raised $48.2 million in net proceeds. Investors now know that was largely conducted to pay for the Agilent legal settlement, which will consume roughly half of the proceeds. In a little over 15 months as a publicly traded company, multiple stock offerings from Twist Bioscience have increased the number of shares outstanding from 26.6 million to 35.4 million. That''s an increase of 33%. Considering the business reported $103 million in cash at the end of December and expects to report a net loss of at least $129.5 million in fiscal 2020, investors should expect additional public stock offerings or convertible debt offerings -- and, therefore, additional dilution -- in the near future. It might be tempting to think the company could just flip a switch and focus on profitable growth, but a closer look at SEC filings suggests that might not be possible. Image source: Getty Images Investors know Twist Bioscience as the company that makes synthetic DNA. It serves industrial and pharmaceutical customers that require (relatively) large amounts of DNA for high-throughput genetic engineering research. It''s by far the best in the industry -- even supplying some of its competitors. However, most of the company''s growth and profits come from an entirely different market: next-generation sequencing (NGS) tools. In fact, NGS tools are expected to generate nearly as much revenue in fiscal 2020 as synthetic genes. It''s a bit ironic that the company known for writing DNA is increasingly dependent on companies that read DNA, but there are two primary reasons for that. First, despite all of the hype, the market for synthetic DNA is simply not very large and isn''t very profitable (if it''s profitable at all). Roughly 25% of the company''s synthetic gene revenue in fiscal 2020 will come from a single customer. It''s also worth noting that the business didn''t begin generating gross profit until it ramped up sales of NGS tools. Second, Twist Bioscience''s technology platform is well suited for designing NGS tools. The company uses its ability to synthesize accurate DNA sequences to create high-quality target enrichment probes, which allow researchers to detect specific genetic sequences in biological samples. But investors cannot conflate early success in the NGS market with being on the path to profitability. Sales of target enrichment probes are far from sufficient to offset losses from the remainder of the business. The company expects roughly half of fiscal full-year 2020 revenue to come from money-losing or low-margin products related to synthetic genes; the other half will comprise NGS tools. Revenue Category Fiscal Full-Year 2020 Revenue Guidance Fiscal Full-Year 2019 Revenue, Actual Change (YoY) Synthetic genes and related products $42 million to $43 million $33.3 million 26% to 29% NGS tools $37 million to $40 million $21.0 million 67% to 76% Biopharma collaboration $1 million N/A N/A Total revenue $80 million to $84 million $54.4 million 47% to 54% Data source: Twist Bioscience. YoY = Year over Year. Despite impressive revenue growth, Twist Bioscience expects to report a net loss of at least $107 million from day-to-day operations in the current fiscal year. That''s exactly the same net loss reported in fiscal 2019, and it jumps to at least $129.5 million when the Agilent legal settlement is included. That also suggests that Twist Bioscience might be stuck financially for the foreseeable future. In order to remain relevant in a money-losing market for synthetic genes and a very competitive market for NGS tools, it must spend significant sums of money on sales and marketing expenses, which are the main driver of operating losses. In other words, although NGS products are responsible for most of the company''s gross profit, they''re also responsible for much of the company''s operating losses. If the company stopped marketing its products as heavily in an attempt to pare losses, then it might not grow quickly enough to achieve breakeven operations. That suggests Twist Bioscience is pursuing growth at all costs because it doesn''t really have any other options. That''s not a very secure position for individual investors. Image source: Getty Images Investors might be drawn to Twist Bioscience because of its industry-leading technology platform for synthesizing DNA. It can create products today for high-throughput genetic engineering experiments or NGS tools, while tomorrow''s opportunities could span digital data storage in DNA or rational design of biologic drugs.  But, to be blunt, publicly traded synthetic biology companies have a downright awful track record of living up to their lofty promises. The best product from the field to date has been hype, and that''s led to terrible outcomes for individual investors who invested on storytelling alone. Shares of Twist Bioscience have rewarded investors with solid gains since the IPO, but swelling losses make it reasonable to question if and when the sentiment will turn negative.   10 stocks we like better than Twist Bioscience CorporationWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

After fading immediately after the companyÃ¢ÂÂs direct listing last year, Slack stock roared 28% higher in just six sessions.   In the short term, thereÃ¢ÂÂs a case for some caution. As of this writing, Slack stock is declining in trading on Tuesday, and a key recent catalyst may not be exactly what investors thought it was. From a long-term standpoint, valuation is a worry: WORK stock isnÃ¢ÂÂt cheap, or close to it. With a major competitor hovering, the story echoes that of another growth darling whose shares have faltered. Still, for growth investors in particular thereÃ¢ÂÂs an intriguing case here. Last month, I called  one of 3 busted initial public offerings to buy (even though the company technically didnÃ¢ÂÂt do an IPO). Even with the recent rally, I see gains ahead Ã¢ÂÂ even if investors might want to let the recent dust settle first. Just two weeks ago, WORK stock looked like it was potentially in trouble. Shares opened their first day of trading in June at $38.50, and from there the trend was negative. Like fellow hyped 2019 IPOs Uber (NYSE:) and Lyft (NASDAQ:), shares quickly fell below their opening price Ã¢ÂÂ and kept falling. Unlike UBER and LYFT, however, WORK never got much of a bounce. Starting in October, shares simply settled into a tight range between $20 and $24. By late January, as we noted in our Big Stock Charts feature, the , with support potentially ready to break. But two catalysts drove the stock back to, and through, the high end of that range. An  RBC Capital Markets sent shares up over 10% on Feb. 4. (Interestingly, WORK rose less than 5% after an even  from Wells Fargo the week before). Then on Monday, Business Insider reported that IBM (NYSE:) was moving its entire workforce Ã¢ÂÂsome 350,000 employees Ã¢ÂÂ onto the platform. Shares ripped again, gaining 15%. The near-term worry is that both those catalysts may not be strong enough even to keep WORK at current levels. ItÃ¢ÂÂs worth noting that RBCÃ¢ÂÂs upgrade only instituted a price target of $25 Ã¢ÂÂ below where WORK trades as of this writing (Wells FargoÃ¢ÂÂs target was $30). Analysts on the whole see upside to $27.32 over the next twelve months, just single-digit percentage upside from current levels. And so Wall Street may not provide another positive catalyst any time soon. As for the IBM deal, Slack itself threw some cold water on the report. In a Form 8-K filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the company noted that IBM  Ã¢ÂÂ -and had been for several years. IBM Ã¢ÂÂhas expanded its usage of Slack over time,Ã¢ÂÂ the company wrote in the filing.  As , Slack in a 2019 blog post said its product was available to 165,000 IBM employees. The expanded agreement covering more than twice as many workers in theory thus could double revenue from SlackÃ¢ÂÂs biggest customer. But in practice, itÃ¢ÂÂs likely that many of the employees not covered last year are unlikely users of the product and not likely to drive much, if any, incremental revenue for Slack. Meanwhile, SlackÃ¢ÂÂs S-1/A filing with the SEC last year disclosed that , not even IBM, represented 10% of revenue. In addition, the company noted this week that it wasnÃ¢ÂÂt updating guidance for its fiscal fourth quarter or fiscal year 2020 (ending January 31). And so with time, the takeaway seems to be that the expansion of the IBM deal isnÃ¢ÂÂt as material to revenue as the market initially believed. At best, it provides a boost of maybe a couple of percentage points. The retreat in Slack stock on Tuesday suggests that some investors are figuring that out. More may do so as the week rolls on. Looking beyond those near-term factors, WORK is a classic good news/bad news stock. For now, the good news seems to outweigh the bad news, particularly with the stock down so significantly from its initial 2019 trading price. The good news is that Slack is posting explosive growth. Revenue increased 60% year-over-year in the third quarter and is guided to rise 55-56% for the full fiscal year. Analysts are looking for a 37% increase next week as Slack inches closer toward net profitability. In a market where growth has been prized, Slack has delivered so far. And thereÃ¢ÂÂs a huge runway here. The workplace messaging app has significant room to expand to uses , as RBC noted. Slack itself has estimated a total addressable market of $28 billion; RBC suggested the figure could be as high as $86 billion. With SlackÃ¢ÂÂs fiscal 2021 revenue coming in below $1 billion, the company has a long runway for top-line growth. The bad news comes in the form of Microsoft (NASDAQ:). The software giant offers formidable competition with its Microsoft Teams, an effort behind which the company has invested in marketing of late. Teams actually has a larger user base than does Slack, though MicrosoftÃ¢ÂÂs ability to bundle Teams with its Office 365 suite obviously helps the productÃ¢ÂÂs numbers. SlackÃ¢ÂÂs product unquestionably has merits, as the companyÃ¢ÂÂs revenue growth has been stunningly quick. Revenue quadrupled just between fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2019. But Microsoft represents a real risk. As a result, Slack stock is reminiscent of another growth name that has struggled in recent years.  In early 2015, Box (NYSE:) went public. The developer of content management software saw a nice first-day pop in its IPO, but like WORK quickly faded. Shares dropped about 50%, a little further than WORK has. A 150% rally over the next two years followed, but BOX declined for most of last year and now trades below its first-day close. Box is an instructive example for Slack stock. Early last year, I noted that BOX came down to an argument as to whether the company would be . Like Slack, Box was competing with giants. And as with Slack, investors wondered whether that made Box an intriguing acquisition target for one of those giants. Buyout rumors have moved BOX higher on occasion, but the company remains independent and its stock continues to struggle. The bear case for Slack is something similar. Teams continues to take share, which makes Slack a less attractive acquisition target. As Slack loses the scale to re-acquire lost share, Teams wins, Slack loses, and WORK stock continues to fade. But from my perspective, the comparison actually highlights the bull case for Slack stock, because of significant differences between the two companies. First, SlackÃ¢ÂÂs competition is direct with Microsoft. Box, in contrast, had potential competitors ranging from Microsoft to Adobe (NASDAQ:) to Alphabet (NASDAQ:,NASDAQ:GOOGL) and even Amazon.com (NASDAQ:). David may be able to slay one Goliath, but likely not four or five. The one-to-one competition also makes a takeout more likely. Amazon and Salesforce.com (NYSE:) already compete with Microsoft, and may see Slack as helpful in that battle. ItÃ¢ÂÂs a simpler strategic case for those giants to make to their shareholder and boards of directors. The second distinction is that SlackÃ¢ÂÂs offering simply is better than most. ItÃ¢ÂÂs a hugely useful,  for workplace productivity. And it will only get better over time. Slack has a much better chance of overcoming the edge MicrosoftÃ¢ÂÂs massive existing base provides than do other smaller software companies who lack differentiated offerings. Valuation admittedly is a concern. But by the standards of this market, Slack stock isnÃ¢ÂÂt terribly expensive at about 15x FY21 revenue estimates. To be sure, Ã¢ÂÂby the standards of this marketÃ¢ÂÂ is problematic for some investors, and itÃ¢ÂÂs possible high-growth stocks are due for a fall. But analysts and investors can model upside here if Slack keeps delivering the levels of growth that are hard to find anywhere in this market. And so the long-term case here is attractive. But, again, IÃ¢ÂÂm not sure investors need to rush in. The gains from the IBM reveal, in particular, seem like they could reverse. Fourth quarter earnings are a potential catalyst, but wonÃ¢ÂÂt arrive until next month. Slack stock has upside over time Ã¢ÂÂ but I donÃ¢ÂÂt think that time necessarily includes the next couple of days or weeks.

Shares of enterprise collaboration platform Slack (NYSE: WORK) whipsawed yesterday, jumping 15% during the regular session only for trading to get halted shortly before the close pending a news release. Once trading resumed in after-hours about an hour later, the stock fell by 7%. Here''s what all the fuss was about. Image source: Slack. Business Insider sparked the initial pop by reporting Slack had landed IBM (NYSE: IBM) as a major customer, and Big Blue was planning to move all 350,000 of its employees over to the chat app. The original report, which has since been updated, made it sound like IBM was a relatively new customer. In fact, IBM has been a Slack customer since 2014. Slack had shared a customer story on its blog back in 2017 about how IBM uses Slack in software development, and another post from 2019 explained how Slack helped IBM unlock value throughout its technology stack by leveraging both standard and customized third-party apps; CEO Stewart Butterfield has framed Slack''s interoperability as a value multiplier. The post last year noted that IBM had 165,000 employees actively using Slack, although it was unclear if that was on a daily or monthly basis. Expanding the deployment would still be a clear win, but investors remained confused around how much upside the news represented. The trading halt -- which sparked speculation that Slack was about to be acquired -- was imposed in response to the article so that Slack could clarify. "IBM has been Slack''s largest customer for several years and has expanded its usage of Slack over that time," Slack wrote in a regulatory filing signed by CFO Allen Shim. Further undermining the article''s original language, Slack noted that it was not updating its guidance for the fiscal fourth quarter -- it had already baked its growing relationship with IBM into its forecast, which calls for revenue of $172 million to $174 million. That dampened the investor excitement (which was misplaced to begin with), causing shares to sell off in extended trading. Large customers that generate over $100,000 in annual recurring revenue are incredibly important to Slack''s business. The good news is that this cohort continues to grow, jumping 67% to 821 at the end of the fiscal third quarter. Slack had no customers that represented 10% or more of revenue through April 2019, according to its prospectus. Adding even more fuel to the fire, Cheddar prematurely reported that insider selling may be the cause of the halt and could be hurting investor sentiment, pointing to fresh regulatory Form 4 filings that showed CEO Stewart Butterfield and CTO Cal Henderson (Slack''s two co-founders) had sold shares recently as part of Rule 10b5-1 trading plans, which allow insiders to set up prearranged trading schedules to avoid violating insider trading laws. Last Thursday, Butterfield sold 2,500 shares and Henderson unloaded 1,500 shares. BREAKING: @SlackHQ has resumed trading after reports of a disposition of shares by its CTO and CEO. #CheddarLive $WORK pic.twitter.com/9ToePLindT \n However, that news was also not quite news. Butterfield sells 2,500 shares literally every day, which is reflected in his steady string of daily Form 4 filings, and the same is true of Henderson (except he unloads 1,500 shares per day). Company insiders often use initial public offerings as an opportunity to cash out a chunk of shares in an orderly fashion, but since Slack went public with a direct listing instead of a traditional IPO, Slack execs have set up trading plans to slowly sell shares without disrupting the market. One of the reporters mistakenly refers to Slack''s debut as an IPO, while the other overplays the relevance of the insider activity by implying the sales were done in response to the pop. The transactions occurred last week, as there is always a lag associated with Form 4 filings. Additionally, trading had not yet resumed when Cheddar ran its segment. Slack has not yet scheduled its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings release.  10 stocks we like better than Slack TechnologiesWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

It''s no surprise that it''s relatively easy to find an article suggesting that cloud gaming is the future of video games. What might be surprising is that the article I mentioned above is from 2012. The worry about console gaming''s decline then was connected to the popularity of mobile games. In today''s world, where companies from Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) to Alphabet are jumping into cloud gaming with both feet, is this the end of the traditional console? In a word, no. Mobile gaming has been a fast-growing part of the gaming market, yet it didn''t spell the end of traditional consoles. In the same way, cloud gaming services may take a portion of the market, but they won''t take over the industry, as some analysts assume. Just to put the future of gaming into numbers, industry analyst Newzoo found spending on video games reached more than $150 billion in 2019. By 2022, total spending is expected to fall just short of $200 billion. This same study suggests that mobile gaming will make up nearly half of all game revenue. Console gaming isn''t expected to disappear either, reaching more than $61 billion by 2022. Given this backdrop, there are multiple myths about the future of cloud gaming that investors need to squash right away. Image credit: Getty Images Many articles related to cloud gaming suggest that the cost of hardware is a barrier. What investors should remember is that just because an argument is made repeatedly doesn''t make it true. There have been approximately eight generations of game consoles. Console sales tend to overlap as older models become a better value relative to newly introduced systems. Since 1972, the average console cycle has been just over 13 years on average. Using this as a template, the argument for a cloud-exclusive gaming subscription is challenging to accept. System Initial Cost Monthly Cost 5-Year Total Cost Microsoft Xbox One S 1TB – Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order bundle $299 $5 (Xbox Live Gold 12-month price) $594 PS4 1TB Slim Fortnite Neo Versa Bundle $299 $5 (PlayStation Plus) $599 Google Stadia Premium Edition $129 (comes with a three-month Stadia Pro subscription) $9.99 (Stadia Pro) $698.43 Microsoft xCloud $59.99 (Xbox One controller) $15* (xCloud suggested pricing) $959.99* (Source: Xbox One S 1TB and Xbox Live 12mo; PS4 1TB Slim Fortnite Neo Versa Bundle and PlayStation Plus 12mo; Google Stadia Premium Edition and Stadia Pro monthly subscription; Microsoft xCloud requires Xbox controller and *xCloud suggested pricing -- author''s 5yr calculation) If saving money is the goal, Google Stadia and xCloud leave much to be desired. Xbox Live Gold gives subscribers at least three free games per month. Over a five-year period, users would have access to 180 free games. Many analysts are looking for cloud gaming services to become the Netflix of gaming with unlimited access to tons of free titles. Google Stadia offers one free game and xCloud''s test offers about 50 games. Given the pricing, the comparison to the thousands of hours of entertainment that Netflix offers is questionable at best. There are multiple holes in the theory that cloud gaming is a better solution than what is currently available. One big issue is that mobile gamers don''t seem to have a need to pay for these services. Last year''s top-grossing mobile game was Fate/Grand Order. This is a free-to-play anime game. Like many others, the way the game makes money is through in-app purchases. Other top free games include titles such as Johnny Trigger, Paper.io, Roblox and Candy Crush Saga. The top paid mobile games normally have an upfront cost of less than $10. Mobile game revenue is expected to comprise roughly half of total video game revenue in the next few years. Given this fact, the free-to-play phenomenon seems to argue against paying for a cloud-based service. On the console side of the house, the trouble with cloud-based gaming goes beyond the cost. Game publishers are increasingly relying on offering both console level games and mobile games as differentiated experiences. The most recent example is Activision Blizzard''s Call of Duty franchise. Despite the traditional Call of Duty''s predictable console and PC release schedule, Call of Duty: Mobile has met with early success. In the first month, the game garnered 148 million downloads. By point of comparison, Fortnite garnered 35 million downloads in its first month. In addition, many console games offer a single-player mode that doesn''t require online access. When it comes to upcoming hardware releases, the next generation of Xbox and PlayStation reportedly will offer 8K resolution and solid-state drives (SSDs). These improvements should allow consoles gamers to experience faster load times and quicker updates. When we combine the popularity of free-to-play mobile games, a long hardware cycle, potentially better graphics and load times, it seems the industry is already addressing the needs that cloud gaming was hoping to answer. The third myth surrounding cloud gaming is because music and movies both moved from physical media to streaming services, video games are the next logical industry to take this step. The first issue is that streaming high-quality music or DVD-quality video require significantly less bandwidth than a video game. Google Stadia says that to achieve 4K quality gaming, subscribers need 30 to 35 Mbps internet speeds. While this speed is achievable for many, one challenge facing cloud gaming is internet provider data caps. Comcast gives a 1 TB monthly data allowance, which sounds like a significant amount. However, a study last year found the average gamer worldwide spent about 7 hours per week playing video games, an annual increase of more than 19%. To put this into perspective, 28 hours of 4K gaming on Google Stadia would use about 430 GB in a month. If we add to this deluge of data, the fact that last year worldwide users spent nearly 7 hours per week on average streaming video, we can see that this 1 TB of data could be used up much faster than some would realize. From an investment standpoint, Microsoft seems to be a better gaming prospect than Alphabet at present. One of the challenges facing the company will be the pricing of xCloud. If the service prices at $15 a month, as some expect, Microsoft may need to combine xCloud and its popular Game Pass service to make the cost palpable. Game Pass gives users access to about 100 games they can download and play as much as they want. Subscribers are already paying $14.99 per month for this service. Having access to Game Pass through xCloud could cause Game Pass subscription revenue to jump. On the other hand, if Microsoft requires gamers to pay $15 for xCloud, and $14.99 for Game Pass, the cloud gaming dream could be a tough pill to swallow. On a positive note, in Microsoft''s last conference call, CEO Satya Nadella said, "We set a new record for Xbox Live monthly users again this quarter, led by the strength of Console." In addition, he mentioned Xbox Game Pass subscribers more than doubled. In short, Microsoft already has a subscription gaming model in place. Between the company''s nascent cloud offerings, the ubiquity of Office, and an upcoming refresh of gaming consoles, Microsoft''s pillars of growth are clear. Investors looking to cash in on gaming''s future should have Microsoft on their buy list.  10 stocks we like better than MicrosoftWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

While the NFL''s Super Bowl championship game played on Feb. 2 undoubtedly had a lot to do with the amount of money wagered, the state has become the country''s sports betting capital since the Supreme Court struck down the federal law prohibiting wagers on sports in 2018. Now New Jersey is looking to capitalize on that by expanding into esports. Image source: Getty Images. Esports is huge and getting bigger. Data analytics firm Newzoo says esports global revenue surpassed $1 billion in 2019, and viewership is expected to hit 646 million people by 2023, a 9% compound annual growth rate, according to Business Insider Intelligence. Moreover, the biggest names in technology, including Alphabet''s Google, Apple, and Microsoft, are competing for market share for live-streaming esporting events. China''s Tencent is the world''s biggest esports company, generating over $20 billion from the industry, but Sony is quickly gaining ground, while Activision Blizzard and Google are partnering to host esports events in the cloud. In short, esports is a massive opportunity, which is why the gambling industry is naturally attracted to it. New Jersey legislators recently introduced a bipartisan bill to legalize betting on esports, with a few exceptions, such as events sponsored by or affiliated with a high school, or ones where most of the competitors are under 18.  Using the state''s 2018 sports betting legislation, the new law would expand the definition of a sports event to include any skill-based attraction, including awards competitions and even competitive eating contests. (Hey, hot dog eating contests could be big!) The law was previously changed to allow betting on video game tournaments where participants were adults. The gambling enforcement division actually allowed sportsbooks to accept wagers placed on esports'' League of Legends World Championship in Paris that ran from October to November.  Support for the bill is driven by efforts to help Atlantic City survive. The state has been in the forefront of making gambling more accessible, and spearheaded the drive to legalize sports gambling and eliminate Nevada''s monopoly. It was also one of the pioneers in online gambling, which has been fueled by FanDuel, which partnered with the Meadowlands Racetrack, and DraftKings, which partnered with Resorts Atlantic City. Sportsbooks and online gambling sites have to be affiliated with either a physical casino or racetrack.  FanDuel and DraftKings, which recently filed for an IPO, control about 80% of the online market in the state through their partnerships with The Meadowlands Racetrack and Resorts Casino, respectively, though FanDuel is the biggest U.S. sportsbook with a 60% share. Yet only half of the state''s 10 operators in New Jersey were able to report seven-figure sports wagering revenue in January. By expanding the law to include esports, it could make Atlantic City casinos much more popular with millennials.  New Jersey Sports Wagering Gross Revenue-January 2020 Retail Revenue Internet Revenue Total Revenue Bally''s $164,575 $491,164 $655,739 Borgata $723,927 $2,460,264 $3,184,191 Golden Nugget $116,266 $431,643 $547,909 Hard Rock ($4,467) $340,933 $336,466 Harrah''s $107,424 $0 $107,424 Ocean Casino $377,369 $1,963,678 $2,341,047 Resorts Casino $163,436 $15,895,379 $16,058,815 Tropicana $100,288 $74,379 $174,667 Meadowlands Racetrack $4,275,047 $22,197,511 $26,472,558 Monmouth Racetrack $883,716 $2,799,094 $3,682,810 Data source: NJ Division of Gaming Enforcement. Table by author. Gambling at physical casinos appeals to an older demographic, but the group of gamblers who most often bet online are between the ages of 25 and 34, and make up over 35% of the total. In contrast, the average age of esports players ranges from around 21 for League of Legends to about 25 for Super Smash Bros. Melee. The average age of esports viewers is 28, which might be older than you''d suspect, but in comparison to major league sports championship games, where the average viewers are in their 40s, these are young whippersnappers. They also have money to burn, with an average income of $50,000 or more. Esports betting is the next logical progression, and New Jersey could be a pioneer once again if it passes this bill. It has bipartisan support in the lower house of the legislature, and the state''s gambling regulator fully supports its passage.  Because online gambling is the only real growth channel in New Jersey, extending the law to esports, which may then find more tournaments hosted in Atlantic City (the first one was held at Caesars Resorts casino in 2017), could be a major growth opportunity.  10 stocks we like better than Tencent HoldingsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

That''s coming off a 55% gain in 2019. The software giant now sports a market capitalization of more than $1 trillion, alongside Apple, Alphabet, and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN).  With such a run-up in shares, some investors may think shares can''t go any higher. But with a cloud business that''s booming, a new Windows 10 OS slated for this year, and perceived stability in a time of increasing uncertainty, there are numerous reasons why Microsoft''s stock is poised to move even higher.  Image source: Getty Images. Take Microsoft''s cloud business for starters. Its Azure cloud has been driving significant growth for the company. In fiscal Q2, Azure revenue jumped 62%, helped by a multi-year, $10 billion Pentagon contract Microsoft inked during the quarter. The contract, which is being contested by rival Amazon , gives Microsoft an entrance into the federal government, which is in the process of digitizing its data and consolidating its cloud vendors. The government is a big opportunity for Microsoft to expand its cloud business. It also landed Salesforce as a cloud customer, further driving growth.  Microsoft is still a small player in the cloud market when compared to Amazon Web Services, but it is slowly and methodically closing the gap. Winning the Pentagon contract, which was expected to go to AWS, underscores its growing reputation in the industry. But gaining market share won''t matter as much as creating reasons to use the cloud will. The companies that can boost cloud usage will be the ones that emerge victoriously.  Microsoft''s CEO seems to get that. During the company''s earnings conference call Satya Nadella laid out his vision over the next decade: "The defining secular trend will be the increasing rate of digitization of people, places and things. This malleable power of software will drive productivity growth across all industries, leading to more inclusive economic growth far beyond the domains of consumer tech today," he said. If his vision proves correct, there''s a lot more upside left in Microsoft''s stock. For months Microsoft has been teasing Windows 10X, a massive overhaul of the Windows 10 operating system to support dual-screen devices. A big upgrade with the new OS is the ability for users to install updates in less than 90 seconds with one reboot. Microsoft also released development tools so developers can begin building dual-screen apps running on the new OS. The OS is aimed at supporting the Surface Neo and Surface Duo, the two foldable devices Microsoft is launching just in time for the holiday season. The Surface Neo is a foldable tablet while the Surface Duo is a mobile device. The latter marks Microsoft''s reentrance into the mobile phone market.  If the foldable device market takes off, Microsoft can benefit two-fold. It can license its Windows 10X OS to computer and device manufacturers. It can also develop its own mobile devices that run on the Windows 10X OS. The market appears to be heading the way of foldables. This week Samsung rolled out its Galaxy Z Flip phone, which is a foldable phone that closes like an old-school flip phone but opens into a full phone with a 6.7-inch OLED display. Market research firm Gartner predicts there will be 30 million foldable phones in the market by 2023, accounting for 5% of the high-end mobile phone market.  Whether it''s coronavirus or trade wars, there''s a lot of uncertainty in the markets. That''s particularly true for tech stocks, which have exposure to Asia. One company that isn''t too impacted by it all, however, is Microsoft. Sure, it has staff in China, but it doesn''t have a slew of retail locations or suppliers it relies on in the region. It''s one of the reasons shares have held amid coronavirus fears.  Outside of the coronavirus epidemic, its recurring subscription-based revenue gives investors stability. In a slowing economy, companies serving enterprises tend to do better than consumer-facing ones. Microsoft does have a large consumer business, but the enterprise side trumps that. Revenue from Microsoft''s productivity and business processes and intelligent cloud units were $22 billion combined in the second quarter compared to $11.1 billion from its personal computing unit. Investors seeking a position in a technology stock but who can''t stomach the risk may flock to Microsoft, driving up the price further. Microsoft''s stock is on a tear but there''s still time to take advantage of the momentum. With business booming and promising product developments on the horizon, Microsoft should be able to continue to reward investors in the months to come.   10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

As the company seeks to integrate Red Hat into its operations and further transition into a cloud company, CEO Ginni Rometty announced she will depart her post in April. The stock has not fared well under Rometty. IBM stock went for about $186 per share when she took over as CEO in January 2012. Today, it sells for about $153 per share. Now, as the head of IBM''s cloud division takes over the company, investors will see if new leadership can turn IBM stock around. To that end, the performance of incoming CEO Arvind Krishna will likely determine where IBM stock trades five years from now. The company has reinvented itself many times since its founding in 1911. IBM is now working to recreate itself again, making the multinational information technology company increasingly into a cloud company to compensate for the growing concern that most of its divisions are seeing declining revenue. To speed along this reinvention, it purchased Red Hat for $34 billion in 2019. Image source: Getty Images. Investors don''t yet know if Krishna can orchestrate a turnaround. But they did greet his appointment to the position positively by pricing up IBM stock more than 13% since the company announced the change on Jan. 31. Born in India, Krishna has worked at IBM since completing his Ph.D. at the University of Illinois in 1990. He rose in the ranks, eventually becoming the senior vice president of cloud and cognitive software. This has led many to make comparisons to Satya Nadella, another Indian immigrant, who rose to the CEO position at Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) after leading its cloud division. Many credit Nadella with turning Microsoft around and making it the third company to reach $1 trillion in market cap. It''s too early to tell whether Krishna will have the same effect on IBM. By putting the head of the cloud division in charge of the entire company, it''s clear IBM is signaling Wall Street that it will definitely go in that direction. However, Krishna and Nadella are different people; by no means do similar resumes promise similar results. Moreover, Microsoft made this move six years ago, when the cloud environment was dramatically different and Amazon was its only sizeable competitor. Now Alphabet, Apple, and numerous businesses large and small are competing in the cloud market. Even with the help of Red Hat, becoming a leader in the cloud will become a challenge. Also, the cost of buying Red Hat placed IBM in a difficult position. With the purchase, IBM''s long-term debt rose to $58.4 billion as of the end of the second quarter (up from $39.7 billion in the previous quarter). Two quarters later, Long-term debt now stands at $54.1 billion, but it remains a considerable burden since the company only holds $21 billion in stockholders'' equity (the value left after subtracting liabilities from assets). And with only $8.2 billion in cash, IBM''s growth options if its cloud strategy fails are greatly reduced. Still, this company hasn''t survived for more than 100 years without adapting to changing times. Loyal investors have to assume it can do so yet again. Moreover, a turnaround may already be underway. IBM''s profits hit a low point in 2017 when the company earned $5.8 billion. By 2019, net income had risen to $9.4 billion. This happened even though three of IBM''s five divisions saw revenue declines in 2019. Analysts also forecast that profit growth will average 7.3% per year over the next five years. Furthermore, the forward P/E ratio comes in at just 10.8, less than half of the average P/E ratio of 22.4 for the S&P 500. Investors can also earn a dividend yield of more than 4.1%, a payout that has increased for 24 consecutive years. The dividend payout ratio, the percentage of profit going to the dividend, now stands at 60.8%. That''s a significant expense but a manageable rate for this company. And with IBM on the cusp of "Dividend Aristocrat" status, the payout hikes will more than likely continue. In the end, company leadership will play a significant role in determining where IBM stock trades five years from now. Though the company appears poised to follow in Microsoft''s footsteps, investors cannot know for sure that history will repeat. Also, given the declines in most of IBM''s divisions and the company''s financial situation, IBM does not have an obvious Plan B should its cloud strategy fail. Plan A appears solid with an incoming CEO comes from the cloud division (a current growth area for the company) and overall revenue and profits trending higher since 2017. Furthermore, with a low P/E ratio and a rising dividend yielding over 4%, investors have some incentive to open a position. But, in the end, where IBM will be five years from now depends on the leadership of Arvind Krishna. If he can turn IBM into a major cloud player, IBM stock will likely trade at much higher levels by 2025. Should he fail, it may point to serious trouble for this tech stock.  10 stocks we like better than IBMWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

A stumbling block for broader benchmarks today was investorsâ preference for defensive sectors, also known as safe havens, such as real estate and utilities. Those are two of the smallest sector weights in the S&P 500 and the Dow features no exposure to those groups. The Commerce Department said today that retail sales increased 0.3% last month, while the December reading was revised down to 0.2% from 0.3%. âSales at building material stores jumped 2.1%, the most since last August, after rising 1.3% in December. Sales were likely boosted by unseasonably mild weather,â CNBC. And there is the explanation for Home Depot (NYSE:) being one of the better names in the Dow today, though thatâs not saying much because in late trading, just 12 Dow stocks were higher and only one, Visa (NYSE:V), was up more than 1%. Nike (NYSE:) inched up in late trading. Infamous lawyer Michael Avenatti was found guilty of three extortion charges involving the company. He supposedly had evidence that Nike paid amateur basketball players and used that as leverage in attempt to get cash out of Nike. Nike, rightfully so, fought Avenatti the right way â in a court of law â and emerged victorious. In other news, the companyâs newest self-lacing sneaker debuts at some retailers this weekend. Iâll take a leap of faith and assume that nearly everyone reading this knows today is Valentineâs Day. While the retail implications of this particular âholidayâ arenât on par with Christmas, itâs still worth noting that the National Retail Federation (NRF) is  in spending for the February holiday. Walmart (NYSE:) and Walgreens (NASDAQ:) would be the Dow components with decent leverage to the Valentineâs theme. Speaking of Walmart, the largest U.S. retailer reports quarterly results next Tuesday.  Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:) was among the Dow losers today, albeit in modest fashion, on news that 21 states, Puerto Rico and Washington, DC, are rejecting an $18 billion settlement offer from opioid wholesalers. The issue for JNJ here isnât so much about the dollar figure the company is on the hook for (itâs an amount it can easily afford). Itâs more about how long these headlines are going to be an overhang for the company. Friday was the type of choppy day seasoned investors know to expect when a long weekend is looming and with the new coronavirus from China issue far from being put to rest, some equity market lethargy is to be expected. Although there are just four trading days next week (markets are closed Monday), there is the potential for some sector-specific volatility with Walmartâs earnings report and the Feb. 19 Democratic debate (healthcare).
