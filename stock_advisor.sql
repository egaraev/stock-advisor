However, Sony''s upcoming Playstation 5 may already have a big lead in that race. According to MBLM''s Brand Intimacy 2020 Study, Playstation was the top-ranked brand among millennials, climbing eight spots from last year''s study and jumping other top consumer brands in the process.  Playstation now ranks ahead of Amazon.com, Target, Walt Disney, Apple, and YouTube. Microsoft''s Xbox ranked ninth on the list. Image source: Getty Images. The gaming industry has been growing at a steady clip in recent years, thanks to the rising popularity of mobile gaming and esports. Market researcher Newzoo expects sales from mobile games and console titles to comprise 80% of industrywide sales by 2022.   While the esports market generated only about $1 billion in revenue last year, it is growing rapidly.  Managing partner of MBLM, Mario Natarelli, credits esports for Playstation''s climb in the brand study. "The combination of the esports phenomenon and impact of hardware platforms has likely fueled PlayStation''s rise in the rankings," Natarelli said in a press release. "Impressively, more than 50% of millennials in our survey are in some form of intimacy with the brand."  Sony''s Playstation 4 (launched in 2013) has shipped 107 million units, while Microsoft''s Xbox One has shipped 46 million. Better technology in the new consoles should lead to growth in sales for both companies'' gaming segments, but the Playstation 5 may continue to outsell Xbox.  10 stocks we like better than SonyWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

From last night to this morning, Johns Hopkins University''s coronavirus tracking website recorded 3,173 new cases of the disease -- a 10% increase. Compared to a week ago, today''s 31,526 confirmed cases represent a 179% increase in infections.   A total of 638 people have died from the coronavirus, and 1,764 patients have fully recovered. Image source: Getty Images. Business in China, the origin place of the illness and the country most affected by coronavirus today (99% of all cases reported), is starting to feel serious effects. In Shenzen for example, Bloomberg reports Foxconn, Apple''s (NASDAQ: AAPL) primary contractor for production of iPhones and other electronic devices, has instructed employees to not return to work at the end of their Lunar New Year holiday on Feb.10.   At least two companies, Canada Goose (NYSE: GOOS) and Burberry (OTC: BURBY), have blamed coronavirus concerns for reductions in their forward earnings guidance. A third clothier, VF Corp (NYSE: VFC), says it''s closing 60% of its stores in China temporarily in response to the health crisis. And coronavirus concerns are starting to be felt even outside of China. Citing fears of infection, two major tech companies, Sweden''s Ericsson (NASDAQ: ERIC) and South Korea''s LG Electronics, have pulled out of the upcoming MWC Barcelona 2020 tech conference. A third tech giant, Finland''s Nokia (NYSE: NOK), is mulling a similar move. And closer to home, the Royal Caribbean (NYSE: RCL) cruise ship Anthem of the Seas was boarded by officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the port of Bayonne, New Jersey who screened 27 passengers for coronavirus and removed four from the vessel for evaluation at a local hospital.   Royal Caribbean shares are down 3.3% as of 11 a.m. EST this morning in response to the news.  10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Worldwide smartphone shipments fell by more than 4% in 2018, and when the final tally is done, it''s expected to show that the declines continued into 2019, falling an additional 1.4%, according to market intelligence company IDC. The growing penetration of the smartphone and incremental technological innovations are simply prompting users to keep their devices longer. There''s also been little doubt that a large chunk of Apple''s future growth will come from wearables, which is especially true regarding the Apple Watch and AirPods. New data reveals that in 2019, the Apple Watch outsold the entire Swiss watch industry -- combined. Image source: Apple. The Apple Watch sold nearly 31 million units last year, up 36% year over year, and selling far more timepieces than the whole Swiss Watch industry, which sold about 21 million units, according to a report by research and consulting firm Strategy Analytics. The data suggests that Apple continues to steal market share from the traditional timepiece industry, as sales of Swiss watches slipped 13%. A previous report shows that Apple also controls nearly half of global smartwatch shipments, with 48% of the market, more than its next two competitors combined. Samsung accounts for 13% of sales, while Fitbit (NYSE: FIT) represents about 11%.  "A blend of attractive design, user-friendly tech and sticky apps makes the Apple Watch wildly popular in North America, Western Europe and Asia," said Steven Waltzer, senior analyst at Strategy Analytics. The Apple Watch has been a fan favorite since it was first released in early 2015, radically changing what consumers expect from a smartwatch. Global shipments of wearable devices -- of which the Apple Watch is a component -- climbed to 84.5 million units in the third quarter of 2019, posting year-over-year growth of nearly 95%, while also breaking the record for shipments in a single quarter, according to data from IDC. This was an acceleration from the 29% growth in the second quarter and 55% increase in the first quarter. The majority of the growth was driven by new ear-worn wearables, or hearables (which include wireless headphones and earbuds) -- which accounted for nearly half the market in the third quarter. Apple represented a disproportionate share of growth in the category, shipping 29.5 million units, up a mind-boggling 196% year over year, and controlling 35% of the market. All signs point to Apple continuing its dominance in the wearables category for the foreseeable future. In Apple''s fiscal first quarter (which ended Dec. 28), the company reported record sales of wearables. During the conference call, CEO Tim Cook said that the Apple Watch set "an all-time revenue record during the quarter," while revealing that over 75% of customers who bought the device were new to the Apple Watch, having never purchased one before. The company also set an all-time record for AirPod sales. These records helped Apple generate more than $10 billion in sales in its wearables, home, and accessories segment, up 37% year over year, with "very strong double-digit performance across all five geographic segments," according to Cook. He broke that down even further, saying that "wearables as a category... grew 44%." Image source: Apple. The data shared above and Apple''s recent results illustrate just how dominant the company is in the wearables market and its momentum shows no signs of slowing. It also doesn''t hurt that Apple has an installed base on more than 1.5 billion devices, and more than 900 million of those are iPhones. Evercore ISI analyst Amit Daryanani estimated in November that there were about 75 million Apple Watches and 50 million AirPods currently in use, representing less than 10% of the installed base of iPhones. This gives Apple a vast target market and a long runway for wearables growth. It also gives the stock plenty of room for future gains.   10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The Nasdaq 100 lead the major US indices, gaining 1.5%, the Nasdaq Composite 1.3%, the S&P 500 0.7% and the Dow 30 0.5% while the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) lost 4.6%. The oil market continues to suffer with estimates that China’s oil consumption could decline by as much as 20%.  Despite a second coronavirus death being reported outside of China and the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in China exceeding 20,000 with the death count surpassing 400, the speed of the virus’s international increase appears to have slowed compared to last week, This potential good news coupled with another round of stimulus from the People’s Bank of China — another $71.2 billion of liquidity via reverse repo agreements on top of the $143 billion injection on Monday — led Asian markets to end the day higher, including a rebound in the Shanghai Index today.  European equities have followed suit and are up across the board while US equity futures point to a vibrant market open.  If you were expecting to read about the results of the Iowa Caucuses, we are sorry to inform you that an “election debacle” unfolded yesterday as the Democratic Party found “inconsistencies in the reporting.” According to Mandy McClure, the state party’s communications director, “The underlying data and paper trail is sound and will simply take time to further report the results.” Results could be released as soon as late today.  While this could make for some interesting barbs as we get ready for tonight’s annual State of the Union Address to a joint session of Congress at 9 PM ET, we suspect President Trump will take a victory lap on the economy and US-China trade deal. Investors will be listening to see what is likely to be on the President’s 2020 agenda including a potential middle-class tax cut, addressing healthcare costs and transparency, and infrastructure spending among other things. We’ll be sure to break it all down in tomorrow’s Daily Markets note.  Data Download The December Industrial Producer Prices in the Eurozone fell 0.7% YoY (+0% MoM) compared to the -1.4% move in November, marking the fifth consecutive month of declines. Declines in energy prices were the primary culprit behind the move lower.  The majority of the economic data to watch today will be US-centric and will include the weekly retail Redbook Index, December Factory Orders, the January ISM Index for New York, and IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index for February. Coming off its highest reading in the prior eight months in January and 2019 holiday shopping, we''ll be digging into the February IBD/TIPP with a focus on the Personal Financial Outlook and Six-Month Economic Outlook data. Stocks to Watch Cummins Engine (CMI) reported December quarter Non-GAAP EPS of $2.56, $0.10 ahead of the consensus forecast due in part to quarterly revenue that also topped expectations. Given the company''s core engine business, it''s guidance is viewed as a harbinger of the global economy, which means investors will likely pay more attention to its outlook for 2020 - "Based on the current forecast, Cummins projects full-year 2020 revenues to be down 8 to 12 percent…Revenue declines in 2020 are driven by lower truck production in North America, Europe, China, and India as well as lower projected demand in off-highway markets, including global Power Generation, mining, oil and gas, and construction markets."  Clorox (CLX) reported December quarter EPS of $1.46, $0.13 ahead of consensus expectations even as revenue for the quarter matched the consensus forecast. Clorox boosted its 2020 outlook to EPS of $6.10-6.25 from $6.05-6.20 vs. $6.16 consensus forecast driven by a low single-digit decrease to 1% increase in sales vs. the consensus that calls for roughly flat total sales. Sirius XM (SIRI) reported December quarter results that were largely in line with expectations and added approximately 1.1 million net new self-pay subscribers leading 2019 to end with nearly 30.0 million self-pay subscribers. Total net subscriber additions were 870,000, resulting in more than 34.9 million total SiriusXM subscribers at the end of 2019. Sirius issued downside 2020 guidance with revenue of ~$8.1 billion vs. $8.22 billion consensus with free cash flow approaching $1.7 billion.  Italian luxury carmaker Ferrari (RACE) reported December quarter results that missed EPS expectation despite the 9.7% YoY increase in revenue that outpaced the consensus forecast.  Ferrari shared its adjusted EBITDA should increase to between 1.38-1.43 billion euros in 2020 vs. prior guidance of over 1.3 billion euros that was set in its 2018 plan. Beauty salon company Regis (RGS) reported better than expected quarterly results even though its same-store sales fell 3.6% during its FY2Q as the number of transactions fell 6.6% YoY, which was offset by 3% growth in ticket. Same-store sales service -2.1% and retail -9.3% for the quarter. The Financial Times is reporting “Germany’s government has proposed a clampdown on anti-competitive behaviour by digital platforms, putting Berlin in the vanguard of European efforts to regulate companies including Google (GOOGL) and Amazon (AMZN). The draft “digital law” will strengthen the intervention powers of Germany’s competition watchdog, the Federal Cartel Office.” This bill is part of what is being labeled a “tech lash” that has governments considering “ways to limit the economic and social power of the tech giants and public disquiet grows about the potential threats they pose to competition, privacy and civil liberties.” Shares of Wynn Resorts (WYNN), MGM Resorts (MGM), Melco Entertainment (MLCO), Las Vegas Sands (LVS), and Studio City International (MSC) will once again be under the spotlight following Macau said it will shut its $40 billion casino industry for two weeks in a bid to counter the spread of the coronavirus. Sony (SNE) boosted its outlook citing strong sales of smartphone image sensors as smartphone makers compete to adopt larger image sensors and multiple lenses on embedded cameras for the improved picture quality but warned of an impact from the Wuhan coronavirus on its global supply chain. The company shared its sensor shipments could be disrupted if the spread of the coronavirus forces its smartphone customers to suspend their assembly plants in China for a prolonged period. Yesterday Alphabet gained nearly 4% during normal trading hours only to reverse those gains to end down 1.3% in extended trading after the company reported an earnings beat that was 23% above expectations, but revenue and operating income missed expectations. For the first time, the company broke out cloud and YouTube revenues but didn''t reveal what percentage of YouTube revenue goes to its content creators. Cloud revenue rose 53% from the same quarter last year but operating income came in below expectations as did capex.  Tesla (TSLA) shares are trading higher in pre-market action following Panasonic (PCRFF) reporting the first quarterly profit in its U.S. battery business with Tesla, which followed years of production troubles and delays. This follows yesterday’s 20% gain in TSLA shares that continued the sharp move higher since the company reports its most recent quarterly results last week. The company’s market cap has reached $141 billion which is more than the combined market caps of Nissan Motor Corp (NSANF), General Motors (GM), Ford Motor Co (F), and Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) which have conversely all declined YTD, -7.7%, -7.5%, -3.6% and -11.6% respectively. One the other hand, of the top ten largest auto manufacturers, Tesla has only 2% of total revenues. Yesterday’s traded value as of roughly mid-afternoon yesterday was more than 205 of the traded value for all the stocks in the S&P 500. We don’t think there is a sufficient superlative word this what this stock has done recently. This one goes into the “you cannot make this stuff up” category. Twitter (TWTR) took down the meme-sharing accounts created by Planters, a division of Kraft Heinz (KHC) for its new “Baby Nut” mascot which was unveiled during the Super Bowl. Kraft reported that the suspensions occurred despite having consulted with Twitter before the public even knew about Baby Nut. The nut got cut. Zoom Video Communications (ZM) rose nearly 15% yesterday and is now up 28.6% year-to-date as coronavirus fears have investors looking to alternatives in a world increasingly anxious about travel… even to the office in some cases.  Peloton (PTON) and Flywheel Sports have settled their legal disputes over alleged technology theft and patents. Flywheel, which also produces stationary bikes with connected training programs, will stop using the so-called leaderboard technology that Peloton claims to have invented. In exchange for dropping its challenge to the validity of Peloton''s patents, Peloton will dismiss litigation against Flywheel. After today’s US equity markets close, we’ll be hearing from Disney (DIS), which saw the launch of the company''s new streaming platform Disney+ during the quarter being reported. Expectations are for the service to have attracted around 25 million paid subscribers by calendar year-end.  In response to the coronavirus, Disney shuttered its Shanghai theme park indefinitely on Jan. 25, and theaters may remain closed in the region due to the outbreak. Investors will be looking for any clarity on that as well as an update of the companies 2020 and beyond box office schedule. Overnight it was reported Disney will bring Hamilton to the big screen in 2021.  Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) is also expected to report after today''s close with investors looking not only at the top and bottom-line results but also at the growth of digital sales and plans for the company''s drive-through concept dubbed “Chipotlanes.” We’ll also be hearing from Ford, Gilead (GILD), and Royal Caribbean (RCL) - who will likely have to discuss the potential coronavirus impact after yesterday''s revelation that a passenger who had disembarked in Hong Kong from a Carnival (CCL) cruise had tested positive for the virus. For those wanting a deep dive into upcoming earnings, we suggest visiting Nasdaq’s earnings calendar page.  On the Horizon Thoughts for the Day “We cannot change anything unless we accept it.” ~ Carl Jung "Lead me not into temptation; I can find the way myself." ~ Rita Mae Brown Disclosures The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.

But as shares take a slide, there may be a few buying opportunities with healthcare stocks. With earnings season in full swing, many healthcare companies could move higher if they beat analyst exceptions and guidance. However, which names could reap the benefits? When it comes to large-cap stocks across the healthcare sector, there are plenty of great stocks to buy. That said, the three healthcare stocks mentioned below are exposed to various parts of the healthcare sector Ã¢ÂÂ but they may offer material upside in the short-term. Undervalued relative to peers and/or sporting a nice dividend yield, these stocks could see a boost after their upcoming earnings call. While the market maelstrom may be a factor, consider these three healthcare stocks to buy when looking for opportunity in todayÃ¢ÂÂs market.    Reporting earnings pre-market on Wednesday, Boston Scientific (NYSE:) is richly priced. However, it could move higher if results beat expectations. Analyst consensus calls for the company to report earnings-per-share (EPS) of $0.44. And last quarter, BSX stock beat on earnings by a penny, reporting EPS of $0.39. ItÃ¢ÂÂs no secret Boston Scientific is moving the needle via . But while shares trade at a fairly-high forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 24.2, thatÃ¢ÂÂs still cheaper than peers like Edwards Lifesciences (NYSE:), which trades for 32.4 times forward earnings. Granted, BSX stock trades at a higher forward multiples than peers Medtronic (NYSE:) and Stryker (NYSE:) Ã¢ÂÂ which go for 19.8 times and nearly  forward earnings, respectively. Yet, Boston ScientificÃ¢ÂÂs growth prospects may justify a premium. With plenty of room between it and Edwards Lifesciences, BSX stock could soar to new highs on multiple expansions. Shares have dipped from their 52-week high of $46.62 just before the coronavirus crisis. However, if market downturn fears subside, BSX could bounce back Ã¢ÂÂ and then some Ã¢ÂÂ post-earnings.    Another name just off its 52-week high, Cardinal Health (NYSE:) reports earnings pre-market on Feb. 6. That said, whatÃ¢ÂÂs the key issue with CAH stock? Opioid liabilities. In November, the company estimated their legal liability to be  for what the company calls Ã¢ÂÂits estimated liability tied to the thousands of lawsuits filed by state and local governments against Cardinal and other wholesalers along with pharmaceutical companies over the opioid crisis that is blamed for more than 400,000 deaths over two decades.Ã¢ÂÂ However, this headwind may not be as bad at it seems, as the company would pay this out over an 18-year period. So, while CAH stock may not be out of the woods completely, taking the accounting hit now likely prices in the long-term risk. With investors less concerned, CAH stock has moved higher. But, shares may still be undervalued. Shares trade at a P/E  McKesson (NYSE:) and AmerisourceBergen (NYSE:). But, with a trailing 12-month enterprise value/EBITDA (EV/EBITDA) ratio of 7.76, shares trade well below McKessonÃ¢ÂÂs EBITDA multiple of 9.37. In addition, CAH stock sports a healthy 3.8% dividend yield. With , and a 5-year dividend growth rate of 7.6%, this may be a strong opportunity for a income-oriented portfolio. Regarding potential post-earnings performance, analysts call for quarterly EPS of $1.22. But with the company beating earnings (excluding the opioid liability charge) by $0.18 last quarter, the company may again exceed expectations. With the stock taking a market-driven dip, Cardinal Health may be one of many healthcare stocks to buy this week.    CVS Health (NYSE:) doesnÃ¢ÂÂt report earnings until next week before market open on Feb. 12. But, with the market dip, this week may be a great time to accumulate CVS stock. While consensus calls for the health care giantÃ¢ÂÂs earnings to fall 21.5% year-over-year, the company could surprise again with an earnings beat as weÃ¢ÂÂve seen the past four quarters. In addition, CVS stock sells at a low . With an EV/EBITDA ratio of 10.8, shares are well below Walgreens Boots AllianceÃ¢ÂÂs (NASDAQ:) EBITDA ratio of 13.8. Yet, it may not be an apples-to-apples comparison. Along with its ubiquitous pharmacy chain, CVS is also in the health insurance and pharmacy benefit management business. However, this diversification may be a double-edged sword, as proposed  could impact CVSÃ¢ÂÂs managed care business. That said, thereÃ¢ÂÂs more to this opportunity than valuation. CVS stock offers investors a nice yield of nearly 3%, making it one of many great dividend stocks to buy after last weekÃ¢ÂÂs dip. Granted, the dividend has held steady over the past three years. But, with a payout ratio of just 28%, thereÃ¢ÂÂs runway for increased payouts. All of this combined, and youÃ¢ÂÂve got another member of the great healthcare stocks to buy.

The video game retailer is suffering under a cascade of bad news and more keeps being poured on.  The latest misfortune to befall GameStop is actually a double whammy: With hardware sales plummeting, software sales in a nose dive, and even accessories and pre-owned games in freefall as everyone awaits the console upgrade cycle to begin later this year -- not to mention the absolutely horrendous Christmas season it had -- these were new speed bumps GameStop didn''t need to hit. Image source: Getty Images. Last week Moody''s issued a series of downgrades to GameStop''s debt, increasing the speculative nature of the debt and also increasing its probability of default. While it did improve GameStop''s outlook to stable, the ratings agency noted the outlook for the retailer''s earnings is deteriorating and it has maturities approaching on some senior unsecured debt. Moody''s vice president Adam McLaren was quoted as saying, "Sustained competitive threats from downloadable, streaming, and subscription gaming services, as well as the company''s ongoing transformation to improve profitability and evolve its vendor and partner relationships, elevate the company''s business and operational risk during a period of industry weakness." GameStop''s overall debt rating was dropped from Ba2 to B2, the probability of default was increased from Ba2-PD to B2-PD, and the speculative nature of its liquidity was downgraded from SGL-1 to SGL-2 (SGL means speculative grade liquidity). Now, as much as that indicates a worsening situation, it should be noted that the new ratings still see a substantial likelihood GameStop pulls through. It also means GameStop still has good liquidity and is likely to meet its obligations over the next year. Still, Moody''s recognizes the retailer faces increasingly difficult times as revenue and margins come under pressure, and while it''s possible GameStop can get an upgrade in the future, the ratings agency says it is unlikely. The other problem GameStop has now is getting Cool Holdings to pay up for the Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) products reseller it agreed to buy last year.  The company, which became one of the largest Apple Premium Partners, or companies authorized to resell Apple products and perform service on Apple electronics, has been in a downward spiral of its own. Last month the Nasdaq stock exchange notified it was delisting the company from the exchange as of Jan. 27. It''s also lost executives and directors over the past year and is undergoing a restructuring. In the filing with the SEC, Cool Holdings noted it was in default of its obligations to GameStop because it didn''t make its first quarterly payment for Simply Mac and GameStop said it was exercising its right to demand payment in full. Cool Holdings ended up hiring consultants to negotiate a new payment plan with the retailer. The sale of the Apple reseller had been part of GameStop''s efforts to get rid of underperforming businesses, which had seen it previously sell off its Spring Mobile phone operations. While it is possible it could work out a new agreement with Cool Holdings, it certainly looks like all the trouble the company has makes it seem doubtful. That would bring Simply Mac back onto the books for GameStop, and while it would undoubtedly try to find a new buyer for it, it''s an additional drag on its performance that it doesn''t need right now. As more consumers abandon physical media, having that $8 million cash in the bank would be much better. When it rains, it pours, and GameStop seems to be caught in a deluge.  10 stocks we like better than GameStopWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The question is more about the size of P&G''s yearly increase. There has been a wide range in that metric over the past two decades, with the consumer giant''s biggest hike, 14%, occurring just before the market downturn started in 2008. Its slowest increase happened in 2016, when income investors saw just a 1% boost to their annual income. P&G normally announces its new dividend in early April, and this year shareholders have some good reasons to expect an unusually big raise. Let''s look at a few. Image source: Getty Images. Shareholders went a few years without seeing a single upgrade to P&G''s annual growth outlook. But they''ve now seen three such boosts from the management team, including back-to-back increases over the last two quarters. CEO David Taylor now projects organic growth landing at 4.5% in fiscal 2020. We''re talking about robust, volume-driven sales growth that also translates into market share gains against peers like Kimberly-Clark, which is expanding at a 2% clip right now. That means management this year will be deciding on its 2020 dividend after a period of some of its fastest sales gains in over a decade. P&G''s finances are looking especially strong, too, with core adjusted earnings leaping higher by 18% over the last six months. Gross profit margin is up and selling expenses are down, which has led to an improvement in its already market-thumping profitability. Operating margin so far in 2020 is up to 24.3% of sales compared with 21.8% a year ago. Its dividend is well covered by cash flow, too, with the $3.9 billion P&G paid out in dividends over the past two quarters translating into less than half of its operating cash flow. Notably, Taylor and his team boosted their targets for cash flow and earnings when they reported fiscal second-quarter earnings in late January. There are two other factors that aren''t as supportive of a significant dividend hike in April. First, P&G is predicting a slower expansion rate for the second half of its fiscal year as it goes up against a tough comparison with the prior-year period and as competition targets more of its recent market share gains. Second, management has shown a clear preference for stock repurchase spending since that cash return channel is more flexible. Executives could decide again this year to tilt much more of their excess cash toward reducing the share count. Still, I''d be surprised if we didn''t see a dividend increase that reflects the faster sales and profit growth that P&G is registering across its portfolio of consumer goods right now. That hike isn''t likely to hit the high single digits that shareholders saw in 2013, but it could easily surpass the 4% increase the company has announced in each of the last two fiscal years.  10 stocks we like better than Procter & GambleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Most understand stocks are technically stretched thin and vulnerable to a pullback. And now that we''re in the thick of earnings season, uncertainty comes with the territory. This time around, though, we''re dealing with presidential election primaries against the backdrop of a coronavirus outbreak that may worsen before it''s contained. China has been hit hard but has also injected some fiscal stimulus into its economy. Given all the risks and the corresponding lack of clarity, this may be a time for investors to keep things simple and lean on big, familiar names that can weather almost any storm. THere are three top stocks for February, following a modest but not back-breaking lull from each. Concerns about a global economic slowdown have been circulating for some time now, reaching a climax in September of last year when the interest rate yield curve was most inverted after moving in that direction for several months beforehand. That shift put pressure on financial names like JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: JPM), which would have suffered a proverbial double whammy. Not only would a recession crimp the underwriting, trading, and lending activity that drives the big banks'' top and bottom lines, low interest rates make lending a less profitable business. Image source: Getty Images. A funny thing happened on the road to destruction, though: nothing. The global economy has shrugged off the impact of the tariff war being fought between China and the United States, driving the initial fourth-quarter gross domestic product growth outlook to 2.1% versus expectations of only 1.8%. JPMorgan shares have rallied well since early 2019, reflecting that strength. But, even so, the trailing P/E of 12.4 and its dividend yield of 2.7% say the market is still undervaluing this blue chip name. In retrospect, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) shares were likely due for some profit-taking pressure anyway. While they snapped back from a short-term lull the day after it announced a nice Q4 revenue and earnings beat, they''ve since peeled back again -- one of the consequences of an unfettered 60% gain since early August. The 6% slide from its January peak, however, may well be enough to say this reliable winner is once again bargain-priced. That''s certainly no guarantee Apple shares have hit their absolute near-term bottom. The company still depends on China for technology components and for buyers, both of which have been disrupted by the coronavirus. Interest in its Apple TV+ service has also been disappointing, deflating optimism the company could continue to grow its digital services business at a strong double-digit pace. Plenty of analysts remain unswayed though, including Wedbush''s Matt Bryson. He wrote in response to newly raised concerns, "While China is a major part of our bull thesis and growth story of Apple for the coming 12 to 18 months, we do not view the impact of this virus epidemic as changing the numbers/merits behind the renaissance of growth in China for FY20/FY21." Finally, there''s no denying Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG) looked past the web''s potential to disrupt every part of its consumer goods business. Once-iconic brand Gillette was easily stymied by the likes of smaller Dollar Shave Club, which simply packaged better value with a more charming story, and shoppers also fell out of love with Mom''s preferred cleaning supplies, like P&G''s Comet, opting for seemingly more eco-friendly cottage brands like Seventh Generation. The internet also helped reshape the way (especially younger) consumers buy and learn about niche products, so much so that in 2015 P&G sold off several beauty product lines to focus on rebuilding its core product base for a brand-new kind of consumer. Many investors didn''t think it could happen, however, chalking up Procter & Gamble as a has-been that''s simply too far gone. Now those investors have another thing coming. Although it''s taken a while, CEO David Taylor seems to have steered the behemoth of a company back on track. Results have been buoyed by reworked packaging and smarter deals with retailers -- among other initiatives -- leading to last quarter''s 15% growth in core earnings. P&G shares haven''t really gone anywhere since a huge rally stalled out in September of last year, when buyers finally stopped for a breather and to let the company''s quarterly results catch up with the stock''s price. After more than a four-month hiatus against a backdrop of steady 4% sales growth this year, though, a little market turbulence could actually make a safe-haven consumer goods play like Procter & Gamble all the more worthy.  10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

However, Sony''s upcoming Playstation 5 may already have a big lead in that race. According to MBLM''s Brand Intimacy 2020 Study, Playstation was the top-ranked brand among millennials, climbing eight spots from last year''s study and jumping other top consumer brands in the process.  Playstation now ranks ahead of Amazon.com, Target, Walt Disney, Apple, and YouTube. Microsoft''s Xbox ranked ninth on the list. Image source: Getty Images. The gaming industry has been growing at a steady clip in recent years, thanks to the rising popularity of mobile gaming and esports. Market researcher Newzoo expects sales from mobile games and console titles to comprise 80% of industrywide sales by 2022.   While the esports market generated only about $1 billion in revenue last year, it is growing rapidly.  Managing partner of MBLM, Mario Natarelli, credits esports for Playstation''s climb in the brand study. "The combination of the esports phenomenon and impact of hardware platforms has likely fueled PlayStation''s rise in the rankings," Natarelli said in a press release. "Impressively, more than 50% of millennials in our survey are in some form of intimacy with the brand."  Sony''s Playstation 4 (launched in 2013) has shipped 107 million units, while Microsoft''s Xbox One has shipped 46 million. Better technology in the new consoles should lead to growth in sales for both companies'' gaming segments, but the Playstation 5 may continue to outsell Xbox.  10 stocks we like better than SonyWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The research shows that when consumers connect with brands on an emotional level, they develop a strong sense of loyalty to those brands. The companies behind those brands form better, longer-lasting relationships with their customers, with stronger bonds that can turn into repeat business. The report cites a number of advantages for companies that make these attachments based on emotion. But there''s also a clear benefit to investors: According to the report, brands that customers connect with intimately tend to outperform the average company within established financial indexes for both revenue and growth over the past 10 years. Let''s take a look at the five brands that resonate most with millennials in 2020, and some of the reasons for those connections. Image source: Getty Images. In the wake of the Great Recession, many millennials put off major life choices, like becoming homeowners, starting families, and buying cars. This wasn''t by choice, but the result of high student-loan debt, a difficult job market, and tight lending standards. Soon after, however, the largest demographic began making up for lost time. They approached life tasks like car shopping using the same digital skills and eye toward value that were second nature to them. While other automakers had written off millennials, Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) was busy courting them. In late 2010, the company introduced the value-priced Ford Fiesta subcompact, which was marketed heavily toward these cost-sensitive consumers. The car was packed with technology that millennials could relate to, including its SYNC infotainment system. Ford also used experiential marketing and held contests that encouraged millennials to submit video applications to become "Fiesta agents." Over the coming four years, Ford increased sales to millennials by 80%. As a result, many of those first-time car buyers still relate to Ford. Image source: Author. Nostalgia is just one component of the love affair between millennials and Walt Disney (NYSE: DIS). The House of Mouse had a renaissance of sorts of in the 1990s, capturing the hearts of many young moviegoers. During this period, Disney released such instant classics as The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, The Lion King, and Mulan; these movies became the soundtrack of a generation for many millennials. Disney has since added Marvel, Pixar, and Lucasfilm to its collection, and each studio has a strong connection to the demographic, increasing the nostalgia factor. As millennials have grown and begun to have families of their own, they introduce their children to the stories they grew up with. Millennials are also passionate about their values, integrating their beliefs into deciding which companies they do business with. Disney is still highly regarded as one of the most family-friendly companies out there. Millennials can also now get their Disney fix from the company''s recently introduced streaming service Disney+. As a result, Disney has made frequent appearances as a beloved brand among millennials, making the top five not only in this year''s report, but in 2019''s, 2018''s, and 2017''s. Image source: Target. Many millennials learned firsthand the value of being frugal after the collapse of the economy in 2008 and 2009, which forced many young consumers to return home after college or to stay with their parents longer than planned. A difficult economy instilled a sense of price consciousness in these budding customers. Target''s (NYSE: TGT) focus on price and value -- without coming off as cheap -- is a natural fit for millennials. Target has taken a number of steps to appeal directly to millennial shoppers. The company redesigned its grocery departments to highlight healthier food choices, something that resonates with these younger shoppers. Target has added organic, natural, less-processed, and gluten-free options, and has introduced small-format stores geared toward millennial shoppers. The company has also worked to integrate its e-commerce and brick-and-mortar strategies, a move that appeals to consumers who grew up in the digital age. Image source: Amazon. E-commerce was born about the same time as the earliest millennials, so digital shopping has been a growing presence in their lives for as long as they can remember. Many in this digitally endowed generation grew up on the internet, and have no doubt become accustomed to frequent deliveries from Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN), following in their parents'' footsteps and eventually becoming customers themselves. Using a mobile app and making online purchases are second nature to this tech-savvy bunch, but other factors make Amazon a natural fit with millennials. The demographic''s social approach to shopping involves researching products and reading reviews, and Amazon''s fanatical approach to customer service also resonates with them. By some accounts, 97% of millennials use Amazon, and nearly two-thirds make half their purchases via the online retailer. Image source: Getty Images. The first PlayStation debuted in 1994, and it shouldn''t be much of a surprise that millennials would forge an emotional attachment to Sony''s (NYSE: SNE) iconic console. Millennials embraced technology from a very young age, including when it comes to game play. Mario Natarelli, managing partner at MBLM, wrote: PlayStation has been a strong millennial brand in our study for years and in 2020 has emerged as top performer, especially among men. Similar to our 2019 findings, millennials form strong connections with brands in the media & entertainment industry. The combination of the e-sports phenomenon and impact of hardware platforms has likely fueled PlayStation''s rise in the rankings. Impressively, more than 50% of millennials in our survey are in some form of intimacy with the brand. As a group, the stocks of these companies have returned more than 31% over the past year, easily eclipsing the 22% gains of the S&P 500. That''s not all -- this group''s market-beating performance holds true for the past three-, five-, and 10-year periods as well. MBLM will publish the full study on Feb. 14, 2020.  10 stocks we like better than Walt DisneyWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Investors might be waiting for a steeper pullback, but a trio of high-quality tech stocks -- Baidu (NASDAQ: BIDU), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), and Sony (NYSE: SNE) -- could be worth buying in February, even without a potential pullback brought on by a market retreat. Baidu, which owns China''s largest search engine and third-largest digital advertising business, lost nearly 30% of its market value over the past 12 months as its core advertising business hit a brick wall. Tough competition from Gen Z-oriented rivals such as ByteDance and the sluggish Chinese economy caused its ad revenue to slide year over year over the past two quarters. Image source: Getty Images. Baidu relied on the growth of streaming video platform iQiyi (NASDAQ: IQ) to offset that slowdown, but the unit''s losses throttled its earnings growth. Baidu exacerbated that pressure by ramping up its spending on the expansion of its ecosystem beyond PCs and mobile devices. However, Baidu recently raised the midpoint of its fourth-quarter guidance from 2.6% annual growth to 5.1% growth. It now expects Baidu Core''s revenue to rise 4% to 6% annually, compared to its prior forecast for 0% to 6% growth, and it expects the midpoint of its non-GAAP net income to nearly double, with 50% to 55% non-GAAP net income growth at its core businesses. That forecast indicates that brighter days are ahead and that the expansion of its ecosystem via speakers, voice searches, and mini-programs on its mobile app is paying off. Baidu also allayed some concerns about the coronavirus, noting that its employees would work from home in an extended Chinese New Year holiday and that it would delay its earnings release to Feb. 27. Baidu still faces an uphill battle in 2020, but its stock is historically cheap at 17 times forward earnings and could rally after its earnings report. Microsoft''s stock already rallied nearly 70% over the past 12 months, but its recent second-quarter report suggests that momentum will continue throughout 2020. The tech giant''s total revenue rose 14% annually during the quarter as its non-GAAP net income surged 36%. The main catalyst was a 39% jump in commercial cloud revenue, which hit $12.5 billion and accounted for 38% of its top line. Much of that growth came from its cloud platform, Azure, which generated 64% constant currency revenue growth during the quarter and accelerated from its 63% growth in the first quarter. The unit''s other growth engines, Office 365 Commercial and Dynamics 365, generated 30% and 45% growth, respectively. The growth of Microsoft''s cloud business complemented the growth of its Windows OEM, Surface, and LinkedIn businesses, which all offset the slower growth of its gaming unit ahead of the launch of the Xbox Series X later this year. Microsoft is firing on all cylinders, and analysts expect its revenue and earnings to rise 13% and 20%, respectively, this year. Investors are paying a slight premium for the stock at 27 times forward earnings, but the growth of its cloud business, the strength of its software and hardware segments, and the upcoming rebound in its gaming business all justify its valuation. It also pays a decent forward yield of 1.2%. Image source: Getty Images. Sony''s stock rallied more than 50% over the past year, as soaring sales of its image sensors for smartphones, cameras, and other devices offset its declines in its maturing gaming and consumer electronics businesses. A strong music business, buoyed by its popular mobile game Fate/Grand Order, also brought back the bulls. Sony notably publishes mobile games through Aniplex, a subsidiary of Sony Music, instead of its gaming unit. Sony''s third-quarter revenues rose 3% annually last quarter as its adjusted profit surged 37%. That growth was mainly attributed to robust sales of image sensors, which smartphone makers installed in better cameras and multi-camera setups. Its music business complemented that growth with rising royalties from streaming platforms, and its gaming business should recover sharply at the end of 2020 with the launch of the PS5. Wall Street expects Sony''s revenue and earnings to rise by 4% and 7%, respectively, next year. The stock trades at a reasonable 16 times forward earnings, although it could afford to raise its paltry forward dividend yield of 0.5%. Sony''s upside potential might seem limited, but it raised the full-year revenue and operating profit guidance for its image sensor business over the past two quarters. That rosy forecast could prompt analysts to raise their estimates and lower Sony''s forward valuation -- which would give it more room to run in 2020.  10 stocks we like better than MicrosoftWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Among the largest underlying components of SMH, in trading today Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., Ltd.

These ''''units'''' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand.  Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed).  Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.\n\n \nClick here to find out which 9 other ETFs experienced notable outflows »\n The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.  \n\n\n######################################################\n\n\nIn the current market environment, winning companies riding strong growth momentum appear poised to keep on winning. So it may be worthwhile looking at the stocks that did the best in 2019, rather than the contrarian "dogs" of last year. Semiconductor manufacturing equipment supplier Lam Research (NASDAQ: LRCX) was the second-best performing stock in the S&P 500 last year, but sold off hard with the rest of its sector at the end of last week. And that''s in spite of a really impressive earnings report delivered on Jan. 29, which not only beat analyst expectations across the board, but also gave impressive guidance for the current quarter -- even while factoring in potential coronavirus disruption.  Image source: Getty Images. Ironically, though Lam Research''s stock more than doubled, it saw earnings per share and free cash flow decline in calendar 2019. Chalk it up to Lam proving it can weather a vicious semiconductor down-cycle much better than investors had feared. Though Lam saw non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) EPS decline from $17.44 per share in calendar 2018 to $14.51 in 2019, last year wound up being the second-best year in Lam''s history, and its earnings decline was pretty mild by industry standards.  Lam is a main player in equipment that makes memory modules, especially today''s stacked NAND flash chips. As many know, late 2018 and most of 2019 saw plunging prices for both NAND flash and DRAM memory. Total DRAM industry revenue fell 37.5% in 2019 on a 47.7% price decline, and NAND flash sales declined 23.1% on a milder fall in ASP, as its downturn started earlier than DRAM''s. Thus, basically all of the main memory and storage players cut back significantly on capital expenditures, which means fewer purchases of Lam''s equipment. It''s impressive Lam only saw its earnings per share decline 16.8% for the year, when many of its clients saw earnings plummet by greater orders of magnitude. There were a few reasons its financials held up so well: 1. Foundry and logic saved the day: Though Lam''s memory sector clients were in freefall, its foundry and logic customers stepped up in a big way. That''s because 2019 saw a surge in demand for both 5G and high-performance computing chips with smaller form factors and greater power efficiency. Leading chip foundry Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) reacted by increasing its capital expenditures by a whopping 40% in 2019 to increase its leading-edge chip supply, an unexpected benefit for all equipment suppliers, including Lam.  2. Servicing its installed base: When companies don''t buy new equipment, they need their old equipment to run more efficiently. Though new equipment purchases fell year-over-year, Lam''s installed base grew from 56,000 to 61,000 in 2019, a 9% increase. On the recent conference call with analysts, Lam management said that its productivity upgrades and solutions services business grew 30% last year. Management doesn''t break out how much of its revenue comes from services, but it did say that it was "comfortably above 30% in 2019."  So even in a down year for new equipment sales, Lam was able to blunt the impact by continuing to grow its services business. That should definitely even out further down cycles. 3. Huge buybacks: Finally, Lam''s earnings per share also benefited from aggressive share repurchases. In 2019, the company bought back $3 billion in stock. That was even more than its free cash flow, but Lam is fortunate to have a highly profitable business and solid balance sheet, with $4.9 billion in cash and equivalents against only $4.4 billion of debt and finance lease obligations.  The aggressive buybacks lowered the average share count by about 7.5%, adding further fuel to EPS.  Lam gave more than encouraging guidance for the current quarter, with revenue, gross margin, operating margin, and non-GAAP EPS, all above last quarter''s results. And that guidance included some caution around the coronavirus. Management sees the wafer fabrication equipment industry growing from $46 billion to 47 billion in 2019 to the "mid- to high $50 billion range" in 2020.  That roughly 20% increase will come from continued strength in foundry and logic, even after the strong 2019, as well as a return to NAND flash spending, with DRAM following behind NAND. Lam is probably right to be bullish on NAND in the second half of the year; some analysts have even predicted a 40% surge in NAND pricing in 2020.  Despite this undeniably bullish report, Lam''s stock still sold off at the end of last week over coronavirus fears, and it currently trades at less than 15 times next year''s earnings estimates. If the virus does spread more than feared, it could very well delay some purchases and slow down China''s economy -- an important region for Lam, accounting for 29% of revenue. However, any delays should be just that -- delays. Barring a worldwide recession, there''s a strong imperative for companies and countries to utilize leading-edge chips for 5G and artificial intelligence applications, which means Lam''s products should be in demand for a long time. Though Lam outperformed in 2019, semiconductor equipment stocks still remain some of the cheapest stocks in the technology sector. With management guiding for sequential growth even while incorporating the coronavirus headwinds, Lam looks like a strong pickup for the Foolish long-term investor on the coronavirus-fueled sell-off.  10 stocks we like better than Lam ResearchWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

This drop gave back some of the stellar gains the company had to close out 2019, when shares rose 44% in November and another 10% in December. While there wasn''t any real news for Trupanion in January, there''s good reason to believe that some of the gains in 2019 resulted from a mini short squeeze. Therefore, January''s drop is attributable to a decrease in the temporary demand created when short sellers covered their positions. Image source: Getty Images. Trupanion blew past estimates when it reported third-quarter 2019 earnings in November. Total quarterly revenue grew 27% to $99.3 million. But earnings per share (EPS) was the real surprise. Analysts expected a $0.02 loss, but the company reported a $0.02 EPS gain. That must have shocked traders, as around 35% of shares were sold short at the time. Seasoned investors have likely seen higher short interest before, but 35% is particularly potent for Trupanion. That''s because the stock has low volume. When volume is low for a stock, it takes longer to cover a short position. Because of Trupanion''s low volume and high short interest, days to cover peaked at a whopping 56.8 in December, according to data from Nasdaq. The amount of shares sold short steadily decreased in November and December, before bottoming out in the first half of January. Trupanion''s stock didn''t fall throughout January, but rather dropped from Jan. 8 to Jan. 10. Short interest data is released twice a month. Data on Jan. 15 showed short interest in Trupanion began increasing again during the first half of January -- coinciding with stock''s drop. This indicates that demand for the stock increased while short sellers were covering at the end of 2019, but the temporary demand created by short sellers ended sometime in the first half of January. I want to be clear that not all of Trupanion''s gains in 2019 are attributable to a short squeeze. To the contrary, the company reported solid results that beat expectations. That''s genuine reason for long-term investors to remain bullish and not be distracted by temporary volatility. Indeed, the stock has already recovered 8% from January lows, as investors await this high growth company''s fourth-quarter earnings on Feb. 13.  10 stocks we like better than TrupanionWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Lynch''s common sense approach and quick wit made him one of the most quoted investors on Wall Street. ("Go for a business that any idiot can run -- because sooner or later, any idiot probably is going to run it," is one of his many pearls of wisdom.) Lynch''s bestseller One Up on Wall Street is something of a "stocks for the everyman/everywoman", breaking his approach down into easy-to-understand concepts.

But, at this point in time, I canÃ¢ÂÂt blame anyone for saying it feels like the sky is falling. ThereÃ¢ÂÂs the coronavirus outbreak in China, which keeps getting worse by the day and has already infected more than twice as many people as the SARS outbreak of 2002/03 (and that outbreak hit the global economy pretty hard). U.S. Presidential Donald Trump is going through an impeachment trial Ã¢ÂÂ a rarity in U.S. political history. Not too long ago, the U.S. launched a strike that killed one of IranÃ¢ÂÂs top generals, and now, Middle East tensions are escalating. Meanwhile, Britain has officially left the European Union. Interest rates, which are historically a somewhat good gauge of investor confidence in the economy, are at or near record lows everywhere. The interest rate yield curve in the U.S., which tends to predict recessions, just inverted, again. Does all of this mean that the global economy is headed for a recession and that the stock market is due for a correction? No. On the contrary, I actually think economic conditions will improve in 2020, thanks to easing monetary policy across the globe and easing U.S.-China trade tensions. I also think stocks will do just fine. But, it does mean that thereÃ¢ÂÂs a lot of noise, volatility and instability in global markets, and that traditionally stable fixed income markets wonÃ¢ÂÂt offer investors a lot of yield. Against that backdrop, stable and high-yield utility stocks become quite attractive. With that in mind, letÃ¢ÂÂs take a look at five utility stocks to buy for stability in an unstable market.    One of my favorite utility stocks over the past few years has been American Electric Power (NYSE:). The electricity services provider, which services 5.4 million customers across 11 states, has successfully leveraged customer expansion and stable demand drivers to spark sustained strong revenue and profit growth. Big share price gains have followed suit. Over the past three years, AEP stock is up more than 60%. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs a huge gain for a utility stock. This will all continue for the foreseeable future. The U.S. economy is on solid footing. U.S. consumers are on especially solid footing. So long as that remains true, they will continue to pay up for electricity services, which will help American Electric Power sustain healthy profit growth. At the same time, investors will increasingly seek to play defense as market instability rises, and when they do, most of them will likely turn to AEP stock, given its long history of sustained profit and share price gains. Meanwhile, the stock has a 2.7% dividend yield. That big yield looks quite attractive next to the 10-Year Treasury yield of 1.5%. Given broader market instability, itÃ¢ÂÂs unlikely the 10-Year Treasury yield rises much anytime soon. So, as investors look for yield elsewhere, they will likely run into AEP stock and its stable 2.7% yield.    Another one of my favorite utility stocks to buy when the market starts showing signs of instability is Sempra Energy (NYSE:). Sempra is a multi-faceted energy company that provides energy services to more than 40 million customers globally across Southern California, Texas, Chile and Peru. Inherently, this positions the company for stable operating results, because of its huge size and focus on delivering must-have resources. But, Sempra is selling its Peru and Chile businesses, and expanding its Mexico business. In so doing, Sempra is becoming more stable with better growth prospects than ever, because: 1) Peru and Chile are volatile economies relative to California and Texas and 2) Mexico is one of the more rapidly growing economies in the world with a growing need for energy infrastructure. Investors like this transition. In 2019, SRE stock was up 39%. This transition will continue in 2020. I donÃ¢ÂÂt see any reason why investors will stop liking it. The numbers will remain good. The dividend will remain big around 2.4%. And, above all else, the stock should keep powering higher.    One utility stock that should also provide attractive stability to weather broader market volatility is electric power and gas utility giant Duke EnergyÃÂ (NYSE:). Much like the other names on this list, DukeÃ¢ÂÂs operations are stable and healthy. They provide electricity, gas and commercial renewable services across multiple states. Demand for these services is largely unwavering. So long as the U.S. economy remains on solid footing Ã¢ÂÂ which it should for 2020 Ã¢ÂÂ then DukeÃ¢ÂÂs revenues and profits will move higher. At the same time, so long as interest rates remain low Ã¢ÂÂ and they should for 2020 Ã¢ÂÂ then Duke will have low interest expenses to service its debt, and a relatively high dividend yield, which will appear increasingly attractive to income-seeking investors. All in all, so long as rates remain low and the U.S. economy remains on solid footing, DUK stock should keep powering higher.    Up 45% over the past year and 140% over the past five years, water service provider American Water Works CompanyÃÂ (NYSE:) has been one of the best performing utility stocks in the both the near and long term. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs because this company has strong and stable fundamentals, with strong and stable growth drivers. American Water provides waters services to 15 million people across 46 states and Canada. That makes American Water the largest and most diverse publicly traded water company. Because consumers will forever need water, regardless of broader economic conditions, this positioning as the largest water company makes American Water one of the more stable utility stocks in the market. But, thatÃ¢ÂÂs not why AWK stock is up so much over the past few years. Instead, itÃ¢ÂÂs up so much because there is a huge opportunity for American Waters to sustain 7% to 10% annual profit growth through upgraded plumbing. That is, most water pipes in the U.S. are old, inefficient and need to be upgraded, and American Water is rapidly upgrading this water infrastructure. As they continue to do so over the next few years, American WaterÃ¢ÂÂs revenues, profits and stock price will all move higher.    Much like American Water Works, leading renewable energy and battery storage company NextEra EnergyÃÂ (NYSE:) has been a huge out-performer in the utility stocks category over the past few years, with NEE stock up 50% over the past year and 145% over the past five years. The growth story at NextEra Energy is pretty simple. Technological advancements are pushing renewable energy costs down by a ton, with energy storage costs having . As renewable energy costs have come down Ã¢ÂÂ and as social pressures to Ã¢ÂÂgo greenÃ¢ÂÂ have risen Ã¢ÂÂ demand for renewable energy has skyrocketed. This has led to a big boost in NextEraÃ¢ÂÂs revenues and profits, because the company is a leader in deploying renewable energy. Going forward, as demand keeps rising, more resources will be invested into driving renewable energy costs down even further. As costs keep coming down, demand will keep rising, leading to more resources being invested into driving costs lower. Lather, rinse, repeat. This virtuous growth cycle will power sustained big growth in NextEraÃ¢ÂÂs revenues and profits for the foreseeable future. As it does, NEE stock will keep rising, too.

The stock climbed about 10%. The stock''s rise follows news that activist investor Paul Singer has been accumulating massive amounts of SoftBank stock via his investment firm Elliott Management. Elliott has accumulated $2.5 billion worth of SoftBank stock and has met with SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son to discuss ways to boost shareholder value, according to a report from The Wall Street Journal on Thursday. "Elliott has engaged privately with SoftBank''s leadership and is working constructively on solutions to help SoftBank materially and sustainably reduce its discount to intrinsic value," an Elliott spokeswoman told The Journal. Further, in a statement to media, SoftBank acknowledged that it does believe its shares "are deeply undervalued by public investors." Image source: Getty Images. While SoftBank is a telecom company, it also has significant stakes in fast-growing companies like Alibaba and Slack Technologies. Elliot believes SoftBank is trading at a discount to the intrinsic value of the combined value of its telecom business and its investments, leaving shares undervalued. This presents SoftBank with a unique opportunity in which it can create shareholder value by repurchasing shares. Elliott is reportedly pushing for the company to repurchase $10 billion to $20 billion worth of its stock. Based on the stock''s response to Thursday''s news, investors apparently agree that SoftBank is undervalued and that a $10 billion to $20 billion repurchase program would create significant shareholder value. Shares of SoftBank have lagged the market over the last three years, rising only 22%. This compares to a 46% gain for the S&P 500 over this same time frame.  10 stocks we like better than SOFTBANK CP UNSP ADRWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

By allowing for scalability, ease of use, and better functionality, cloud computing companies have seen tremendous growth as businesses continue to move their IT needs onto the cloud. As a result, software-as-a-service (SaaS) stocks have surged in recent years and cloud infrastructure providers like Amazon.com and Microsoft have also seen a significant tailwind. The chart below shows the massive returns that some SaaS stocks -- including Shopify (NYSE: SHOP), Alteryx (NYSE: AYX), and The Trade Desk (NASDAQ: TTD) -- have delivered in the last few years.  SHOP data by YCharts All three of these stocks have trounced the market and delivered incredible returns. For beginning investors, however, cloud stocks aren''t the most user-friendly. Often, these companies compete in niche corners of the IT world and offer services tailored to IT managers, meaning uninitiated investors may struggle with some of the language and terms these companies use to describe their business and performance. To get a sense of the strength of a given cloud stock, investors can start by examining three key industry metrics. Most cloud businesses -- and we''re talking about the SaaS sector here -- operate on a subscription model. That means these companies have two ways of growing revenue. They can either add new customers or get their current customers to spend more on their platform, generally by upgrading or expanding their service. It''s generally more cost-efficient to grow sales by getting current customers to spend more rather than finding new customers, so it''s important for cloud companies to grow sales to their customer base. That shows those customers are pleased with the service and are expanding their use of the product. Cloud companies have dubbed this growth model "land and expand," meaning they acquire new customers and then grow their business with those customers over time. Image source: Getty Images. To measure growth from existing customers, SaaS companies use a metric called dollar-based net retention, also called net dollar retention or dollar-based net expansion. This number, expressed as a percentage, shows how much of a company''s existing customer base is spending from one year to the next. For example, Okta (NASDAQ: OKTA), a SaaS company that specializes in identity and security, reported 117% dollar-based net retention in its most recent report, meaning sales to its previously existing customer base grew 17% over last year''s sales.  Slack (NYSE: WORK), the popular workplace-messaging platform, posted 134% dollar-based net retention in its most recent quarter, showing it grew revenue 34% from its existing customer base. Using those two numbers alone, you can see that Slack is doing a better job of growing revenue from its current subscriber base. Not surprisingly, its overall revenue growth of 60% was also better than Okta''s at 45% in their respective quarters. SaaS investors will want to make sure that any net dollar retention rate is above 100%, meaning that the company is growing existing customer relationships, preferably with a solid margin of safety. Gross margin is important for almost any business. Generally, it means the percentage of revenue remaining after direct product or service costs are subtracted, also known as cost of goods sold or cost of revenue. In cloud computing, these costs tend to include computing costs like networking and infrastructure to keep the software running and personnel costs like customer service. Since operating costs further down the income statement tend to be more fixed or harder to control, a high and increasing gross margin is one of the best signs of profit potential, especially in cloud stocks, as the company should become more profitable as it scales and matures. Okta saw its adjusted gross margin increase from 75.8% to 77.8% in its most recent quarter, a bullish sign, which also allows it to spend much of its revenue on research and development and sales and marketing, as well as general and administrative costs like corporate employee salaries.  By comparison, Twilio (NYSE: TWLO), a cloud company focused on enabling communications like the text messages that Uber sends you when your ride is ready, saw its gross margin rise from 55% to 58% in its third quarter. While that increase is a positive sign, the lower margin shows that Twilio''s core business model is not as profitable as Okta''s. Cloud companies tend to be fast-growing, but unprofitable. That''s because almost all of them spend significant percentages of their revenue on sales and marketing expenses. These companies aim to capture the potential opportunity in the market and build out customer relationships first, then focus on delivering profits from those customers later.  Therefore, it''s worth looking at customer acquisition costs (CAC), which show how efficiently cloud companies are able to get new customers and grow their business. Generally, CAC is measured by dividing sales and marketing spending by the number of new customers added in a given period. It''s not a perfect measurement, as some marketing spending goes to existing customers, and some customers are more valuable than others, but it''s a good approximation for marketing efficiency. Okta, for example, spent roughly $87.2 million on marketing in its most recent quarter and added 400 customers, giving it a CAC of about $218,000. If the lifetime value of those customers is worth more than the $218,000 the company is spending to acquire them, then it''s using its marketing budget wisely.  Calculating customer lifetime value isn''t always so straightforward and requires the investor to make some assumptions, but investors can also get a sense of customer acquisition costs by looking at how they''ve changed over time. With Okta, we can see that its CAC was just $126,500 in the third quarter of 2018, showing that customer acquisition is getting more expensive. Nonetheless, Okta''s revenue growth has remained strong, while marketing expenses have remained close 60% of revenue from year to year.  Still, investors may want to keep an eye on CAC going forward as eventually sales and marketing spending should come down as a percentage of revenue, helping to drive overall profitability. Of course, there are more metrics than these that cloud investors should consider when evaluating a stock, including overall revenue growth, subscription revenue growth, and free cash flow, but the three above can give investors a good start for understanding the potential of an individual cloud stock.

The business collaboration software expert was boosted by a bullish analyst report. Analyst firm RBC Capital started coverage of Slack this morning with an "outperform" rating on the stock and a price target of $25 per share. That''s 19% above Monday''s closing price. RBC analyst Alex Zukin cited Slack''s market-leading brand power and unique technology, arguing that the company should be able to post revenue growth near 30% a year for the foreseeable future. Will Microsoft help or hurt Slack as the collaboration market evolves? Image source: Getty Images. Zukin also said that the workplace collaboration market is validated by the fact that mighty Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) is chasing it with a heavy focus on its own Slack alternative, Microsoft Teams. The market could grow into an $88 billion annual revenue opportunity, the analyst noted, and Slack''s first-mover advantage would be very valuable in that case. That being said, Slack''s shares have moved largely downward ever since the company joined the public stock market in the summer of 2019, and it trades 40% below its all-time highs -- which happened to fall on the stock''s very first day of trading. Ironically, the same Microsoft Teams alternative that Zukin sees as proof of a massive market also drove Slack''s shares down because it''s a serious rival. Slack is a classic growth stock where its market value rests on sustainable revenue growth and best-guess estimates of profits and cash flow in the far future. That''s why a single analyst note was able to lift its share prices more than 10% today.  10 stocks we like better than Slack TechnologiesWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

That''s up 23% year over year. However, management insists there''s still a long way to go for it to improve its user monetization. "Looking at our current ad products and applying comparative industry [cost per ad impression] to our own inventory, we are in a position to meaningfully close the ARPU gap relative to our peers," Chief Business Officer Jeremi Gorman said during Snap''s fourth-quarter earnings call.  CFO Derek Anderson and CEO Evan Spiegel later said Twitter''s (NYSE: TWTR) ARPU is a near-term benchmark that Snap is driving toward. For reference, Twitter''s ARPU was about $6.28 in the fourth quarter of 2018, but it may have declined last year as it grows its user base faster outside of the United States. Still, it shows Snap''s ambitions to more than double its ARPU over the next few years. The biggest factor influencing whether or not Snap can succeed is increasing advertiser demand, specifically whether it can add more active advertisers. Image source: Snap. Revenue growth at digital advertising giants Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) showed marked deceleration in the fourth quarter, indicating a generally weaker-than-expected demand for digital advertising.  The impact on Snap compared to the bigger ad platforms was much more noticeable, as RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney points out. In a note to investors, he wrote: As a smaller platform with few supply constraints (much more inventory than advertisers), a reduction in advertiser demand has a bigger impact on Snap''s head/premium inventory versus Alphabet and Facebook, where demand changes are more impactful at the tail end. In other words, by nature of having more bidders in the ecosystem, Facebook and Alphabet saw resilient ad pricing, especially for more premium ad inventory. Facebook announced it ended the year with 8 million active advertisers. When asked for an update on the range of advertisers on Snap, Gorman merely replied, "We do have fewer than 8 million advertisers, but a lot of headroom to grow." That said, Twitter also has far fewer active advertisers than Facebook or Google. CFO Ned Segal reiterated during Twitter''s third-quarter earnings call in October that the advertising platform remains "demand constrained." He also neglected to provide an update on how many active advertisers use Twitter. Still, it shows there''s room to improve ARPU without saturating demand or ad load. Gorman outlined three key priorities in Snap''s efforts to increase advertiser demand and close the ARPU gap between itself and the competition. First, improving our measurement, ranking, and optimization to drive relevance and deliver ROI. Gorman says the company''s investments in products like the Snap Pixel (which enables marketers to track ad viewers from impression to checkout and retarget users) are paying off. Ads targeted at consumers lower in the sales funnel are growing, and those ads generally provide greater return on investment than campaigns with a broader focus. The ability to expand its ads to those higher-value ad impressions may attract more small and medium-sized businesses to Snap''s ad platform. Second, building out our sales and marketing functions to support the needs of our advertising partners globally. Snap will invest more in ad sales teams across different verticals and geographies in 2020. Additionally, Snap started investing in a business-to-business marketing campaign in order to attract the attention of media planners. Investing in sales personnel will have a negative impact on operating margin in the short term, but it may be essential to attracting the breadth of advertiser demand that will allow it to catch up to the ARPU levels of Twitter and others. Third, creating innovative ad experiences around video and augmented reality that deliver real business value. Snap''s strengths in augmented reality and visual communication have resulted in several interesting advertising products. The challenge with innovative ad products, though, is that they can be difficult to create for. Snap''s most successful ad product is its 6-second commercial video ad displayed within its Discover content, which is notably easier to create than an AR lens. Snap''s plans to attract new advertisers are well thought-out. While the investments may curb margin expansion, the opportunity to scale revenue is too big to remain conservative.  However, trying to win over advertisers to split their budgets from other tech companies in order to experiment with new innovative ad products on Snap could be a tough sell. The return on investment must be there. And while management pointed out strong returns at scale, smaller businesses may need to invest a lot more upfront in their ad creatives for Snap, making the returns less appetizing.  That weakness could prevent Snap from attracting the long-tail of smaller advertisers that support ad prices when the digital ad market shows lower-than-expected demand, like it did last quarter.  Still, with every quarter of climbing user growth and increased engagement -- particularly on its Discover platform, which offers easier advertising opportunities -- Snap become more attractive. Smaller advertisers could generate more views from a single ad creative.  10 stocks we like better than Snap Inc.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

With a market capitalization just over $1 trillion, Alphabet stock rewards loyal shareholders. Yet those gains are a double-edged sword. In growing profits at an enormous rate, the search engine giant is worsening the user experience. The company is in danger of over-saturating its users with too many ads.   Ask your friends if searching on Google still brings up what they are looking for on the first page. And also ask if the search engine is showing too many ads at the top. If the answer is a Ã¢ÂÂyesÃ¢ÂÂ to the second question, risks are increasing that users may find alternatives. Very recently, the company back-tracked a redesign on the display of new search results. The change would have . Increasing clicks for advertisers would have brought in plenty of revenue, but it would frustrate users. Similarly, the video platform YouTube now shows two ads, one after the other, before a user may view some content. With every increasing dollar of profit per share, the stock will just keep soaring. AlphabetÃ¢ÂÂs reliance on advertising via Google.com poses a risk for investors. As Disney (NYSE:) invests in Disney Plus, Apple (NASDAQ:) on Apple TV Plus, and Netflix (NASDAQ:) subscriptions grow, YouTube may become out of date. Alphabet is diversifying its business. It bought Fitbit (NYSE:) for $2.1 billion. It is trying again to influence shopping ambitions by buying Pointy for . In the gaming space that is largely dominated by Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:), Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:), and Take-Two (NASDAQ:), it is investing in Google Stadia. Stadia launched in November 2019 but in 2020, it will have more than 120 games on the platform. Currently, Stadia has 26 games and one exclusive title. And in the next few months, gamers may expect support for 4k gaming on the web, more support on Android Phones and wireless gaming through the Stadia controller. Investors may forecast revenue growing by least 10%-15% in a five-year discounted cash flow model: earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) exit model. At a conservative discount rate of 10% and a terminal EBITDA multiple of 18 times, Google stock has a fair value of $1,529.   The above stock target is not far from analystsÃ¢ÂÂ average price . And given GoogleÃ¢ÂÂs high growth score of 99 from Stock Rover, investors are getting good value. The industry growth score is 53 and theÃÂ S&P 500ÃÂ has a growth score of 77. Apple reportedly spent billions of dollars to improve its Maps app. Although it is , Apple Map enhancements may sway users away from Google Maps. This is a low risk that investors should still consider. Lower consumer spending due to slowing global economic activity is another risk. Advertisers will cut back on advertising spending, too. This would put pressure on GoogleÃ¢ÂÂs near-term growth. Google has room to squeeze in more ads in several areas of its web properties. Although more ads have the potential to be frustrating, users are typically too lazy or too fixed to find alternatives. Brave Browser, DuckDuckGo search and Firefox browser are substitutes. But for now, there is no evidence suggesting anyone is leaving Google Chrome or Google search. So, holding Google stock should still pay off.

The Dow was down 0.69% at 1:05 p.m. EST, even after better-than-expected job growth was reported for January. Slumping along with the Dow were International Business Machines (NYSE: IBM) and Boeing (NYSE: BA). IBM stock had been surging after the company announced a CEO transition, but it was unable to keep the rally going. Meanwhile, Boeing stock was weak after a new software bug related to its Starliner spacecraft was disclosed. Shares of IBM got a big boost at the end of January when the tech giant announced that CEO Virginia Rometty was stepping down effective April 6. The CEO position will go to cloud and cognitive software chief Arvind Krishna, while the president position will go to Red Hat head honcho James Whitehurst. Between Jan. 31 and Feb. 6, IBM stock shot up 14.6%. The stock carved out a new 52-week high, reaching levels not seen since 2018. Image source: IBM. Shares of the century-old tech company took a break on Friday, falling along with the Dow. IBM stock was down about 1% by early afternoon, giving back a small portion of its recent gains. Rometty''s legacy at IBM is complicated. Since taking over in 2012, revenue, profits, and the stock price have all moved in the wrong direction. However, the company has refocused over the years on growth opportunities like hybrid cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and data analytics. Legacy businesses were sold off or de-emphasized, with resources shifted to areas where IBM could build up competitive advantages. IBM expects to produce revenue growth this year, driven by the Red Hat acquisition and a recently launched mainframe system. If the company can remain in growth mode after 2020, the stock could finally regain the ground it''s lost since topping out soon after Rometty took over. The management shuffle reset the narrative. Now, IBM needs deliver. Boeing is still working on fixing the issues with the 737 Max, which was grounded following two fatal crashes. A problem with a software system was behind those two crashes, and more issues have emerged as Boeing races to get the plane back in the air. Boeing is now having issues with software in other parts of its business. On Thursday, a NASA safety review panel said that a December flight test of a Boeing CST-100 Starliner space taxi almost ended in a catastrophic failure due to a software bug. That test was cut short by a separate issue. The new software bug was fixed by Boeing during the flight, but the panel found that it could have resulted in a catastrophic failure involving erroneous thruster firings. The panel recommended that NASA review Boeing''s software verification process before allowing its spacecraft to ferry humans. The 737 Max debacle has threatened Boeing''s reputation. Yet another software issue won''t help the situation. Boeing stock was down 1.25% Friday afternoon.  10 stocks we like better than IBMWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

IBM has come out swinging, demonstrating dominance in the world of creating and implementing novel use cases for distributed ledger technology. Having secured the position as the private firm with the most new patents in blockchain technology in 2019 — notably including new measures to further improve security — IBM appears poised to retain that title with a barrage of new efforts in this space. IBM’s Latest Blockchain Announcements Continuing its work on the IBM Food Trust — which attempts to use blockchain-based record keeping to allow consumers to easily access the entire production and transportation history of common food items — IBM told the press on February 3, 2020, that it was preparing for a feasibility test with international food regulators, giving the company a chance to get valuable certification for the world of international produce shipping. Setting aside more than $200,000 for the project, IBM is showing regulators how the use of its new software can revolutionize the shipping industry worldwide. Many of IBM’s other recent developments are largely unrelated to the Food Trust, showing the multifaceted nature of its blockchain strategy. Also on February 3, 2020, for example, IBM rolled out its distributed ledger solution for contract laborers, claiming to automate many of the more onerous tasks of payment processing. Automatically tracking things like time sheets, invoices and purchase orders, IBM is seeking to create a ready-made solution to not only streamline the process of employing outside contractors with a company, but also to show the wide ranging ways that blockchain technology can revolutionize modern society. Going beyond these two fields, IBM also partnered with Walmart and Merck on what it is calling the Pharmaceutical Unity Network.  Working to keep all their technologies compliant with the upcoming Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCSA), the companies have been building an open-source platform to help pharmaceutical companies stay within the boundaries of this legal framework. By tracking the life cycle of drugs themselves in a similar manner to its food export initiative, IBM hopes to combat the problems of counterfeit drugs being sold to consumers and legitimate drugs being turned over to underground markets. Exploring a number of other areas where the blockchain framework could prove useful, IBM has been investigating things like drug recalls and clinical trials for further uses of this project. This massive investment into blockchain technology stems from the very highest levels of IBM’s corporate structure. On January 31, 2020, it was made public that IBM’s previous CEO was stepping down, and his replacement would be Arvind Krishna, the senior vice president for cloud and cognitive software, who has been intimately involved with not only the strategic development of IBM’s mad drive on blockchain technology, but also the development of many relevant technologies themselves.  In other words, even as IBM has enthusiastically supported these moves in the past, one of the principle architects in getting IBM’s blockchain efforts off the ground is now steering the entire company. Looking toward the future, it seems more and more likely that 2020 is going to blow IBM’s 2019 record for blockchain development out of the water.
